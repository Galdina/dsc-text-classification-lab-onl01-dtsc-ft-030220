Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"',\n",

I\\'ve heard they\\'re \"in committee\".\\n     How close is that to being made law?\\n\\n2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important\\n   differences I missed?\\n\\n3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:\\n  A. S414 doesn\\'t specify an \"appeals\" process to wrongful denial during\\n     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals\\n     process once the required instant background check system is established,\\n     but not before).\\n  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving\\n     using existing records (so who would I sue in \"A\" above to have an\\n     inaccurate record corrected?)\\n  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person\\n     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an\\n     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.\\n     But S414 doesn\\'t say exactly what is considered a \"threat\", nor does\\n     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception\\n     statement.\\nTrue?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other \\'holes?\\n\\n4. With just S414, what\\'s to stop a person with a \"clean\" record from\\n   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?\\n   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?\\n\\n   \\'Seems at min. a \"gun counting\" scheme would be needed\\n   (e.g., \"John Doe owns N guns\").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn\\'t be surprised\\n   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.\\'s plus national gun\\n   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.\\n\\nPlease comment.

At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.

It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.

As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\\n\\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\\n Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the\\n task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.\\n Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering\\n that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very\\n well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because\\n of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake\\n on the 1-3 goal.\\n\\n Lines information follows further below.\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n ITALY - SWITZERLAND  1-0 (0-0,1-0,0-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: ITA 1-0 Orlando          15:47\\n 3rd:\\n\\n Penalties: ITA 10*2min, SWI 8*2min\\n Referee: Anton Danko, Slovakia\\n Attendance: 3,500\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n Group B results:\\n\\n CZECH REPUBLIC - GERMANY  5-0 (0-0,3-0,2-0)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: CZE 1-0 Kamil Kastak        1:51\\n      CZE 2-0 Jiri Dolezal       12:26\\n      CZE 3-0 Petr Hrbek         19:10\\n 3rd: CZE 4-0 Radek Toupal        8:28\\n      CZE 5-0 Josef Beranek      17:07\\n\\n Penalties: CZE 7*2min, GER 6*2min 1*5min 1*10min game penalty\\n Referee: Darren Loraas, Canada\\n Attendance: 10,200\\n\\n The Czechs were clearly better than the Germans, and the German crowd\\n showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.\\n\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n FINLAND - USA  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)\\n\\n 1st:\\n 2nd: FIN 1-0 Jarkko Varvio      4:00\\n 3rd: USA 1-1 Ed Olczyk          4:26\\n\\n Penalties: FIN 7*2min, USA 6*2min\\n Referee: Valeri Bokarev, Russia\\n Attendance: 2,800\\n\\n I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the\\n whole game).

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.',\n",

I completely agree that we need to work quickly to\\nestablish alternatives to the government\\'s Clinton Clipper. As Brad\\nTempleton and others have noted, once the Clipper becomes ensconced in\\nenough phones there will be enormous pressure to make it the *legal*\\nstandard, and it will become the \"market* standard as well. (There is\\na lot of confusion in the proposal about whether the use of Clipper is\\nmandated, about whether non-escrow alternatives will be allowed, etc.)\\n\\n(There are also unclear issues about how hard, or how illegal, it will\\nbe to make \"workalikes\" which meet the standard but which generate\\nphony or untappable keys...I\\'m sure the next several weeks will see\\nthese issues thrashed out in this and other groups.)\\n\\nMeanwhile, I\\'d be interested to hear RSA Data Security\\'s reaction.\\nOften criticized in this group for their licensing policies (the usual\\ncomplaints about MailSafe costing too much, at $125 or so, and the\\ngeneral issue of software patents...), we may find that *allying*\\nourselves with RSA is the best thing we can do. What\\'s a mere\\nlicensing fee when our liberty may be at stake? (If everyone who\\nwanted true security paid, say, $100 for a lifetime use of all of\\nRSA\\'s patents--which expire in the period 1998-2002, or so--then RSA\\nwould make tons of money and be happy, I\\'m sure. A small price to pay.\\nFor those to whom $100 sounds like too much, I\\'m sure the actual terms\\ncould be different, spread out over several years, whatever. To me,\\nit\\'s a small price to pay.)\\n\\nStrong crypto means strong privacy. Escrowing keys, sending copies of\\nkeys to large databases, and splitting keys into two 40-bit pieces,\\nall done with secret and non-analyzable protocols and algorithms, is\\n*NOT* strong crypto!\\n\\nWhatever some of us may think about the abstract principles of\\npatenting number theory applications, this minor issue pales in\\ncomparison with the potential dangers of the Clipper proposal (note\\nthat I said \"potential\"...we\\'ll presumably learn more in the coming\\nmonths).\\n\\nThe RSA algorithms are at least public, have been analyzed and\\nattacked for years, and source code is available (to better ensure no\\ndeliberate weakenesses or trapdoors).\\n\\nI know of a number of groups putting together voice encryption systems\\nusing off-the-shelf hardware (like Soundblaster boards for the PC) and\\nCELP-type software. The new generations of PCs, using fast 486s and\\nPentiums are fast enough to do real-time voice encryption. Combined\\nwith Diffie-Hellman key exchange, this should provide an alternative\\nto the Clipper system.\\n\\nOf course, we don\\'t really know if the Administration proposes to\\noutlaw competing systems. (It seems to me that their goal of tapping\\nterrorists, child pornographers, and Hilary bashers would be thwarted\\nif low-cost alternatives to Clipper proliferated. Not to defend child\\npornographers or terrorists, but limiting basic freedoms to catch a\\nfew criminals is not the American way of doing things. End of soapbox\\nmode.)\\n\\nI suggest we in these groups set aside any differences we may have had\\nwith RSA (and don\\'t look at me....I have both MacPGP *and* a fully\\nlegal copy of \"MailSafe\"!) and instead work with them as quickly as we can.\\n\\nRSA?, Jim?, are you listening?\\n\\n-Tim May\\n\\nP.S.

Affected programs include rgb and \\nthe server.\\n\\n\\tThis is from the GCC manual:\\n\\n\\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \\n\\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\\n\\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \\n\\treference.\\n\\n\\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\\n\\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn\\'t straightforward to fix it.\\n\\n\\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\\n\\t`-fpcc-struct-return\\' does not help.\\n\\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \\ncompilation flags.  \\n\\n\\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\\n\\t\\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \\n\\t\\trgb/rgb.c\\n\\n\\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\\nreturn values:  \\n\\t\\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \\n\\t\\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \\nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \\nharmless as they don\\'t involve structs.\\n\\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \\n\\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \\n\\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\\n\\n\\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn\\'t work.

While \\nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \\nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \\ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \\nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \\nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \\n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \\nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\\n\\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\\nmost C compilers).\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt?

Although it is not \\nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \\nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\\n\\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \\nobvious.\\n\\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\\nR5 versions are different.\\n\\n\\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\\nusing Imake to build X\\n\\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\\n\\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes\\' R3/R4\\nguide to imake.\\n\\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\\nFulton on an early version of Imake\\n\\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \\nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \\nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \\n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\\n\\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\\n\\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \\n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \\nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\\n\\t- The O\\'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey\\'s article on\\ndemystifying Imake.\\n\\t- Alain Brossard\\'s working document full of tips on Imake is in \\nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\\n\\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\\n\\n\\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \\nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \\nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \\ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \\nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \\ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\\n\\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\\n\\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\\n\\n\\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \\nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \\nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \\nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 109)  Why can\\'t I link to the Xlib shape routines?\\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\\n\\tUndefined:\\n\\t_XShapeQueryExtension\\n\\t_XShapeCombineMask\\n\\n\\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \\nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \\nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \\nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\\n\\n\\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \\nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \\nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \\ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \\nlibraries.\\n\\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \\nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\\n\\n\\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \\nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can\\'t share a function that \\nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \\n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \\nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \\nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\\nbe called.\\n\\n\\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \\n\\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \\nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif\\'s 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \\nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\\n\\t2) alternatively, your program doesn\\'t need any Xt functions and is\\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \\nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \\n\\n\\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\\n\\t\\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \\n11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 111)  Why can\\'t I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \\nthe current version of X, I get this message:\\n\\tUndefined:\\n\\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\\n\\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\\n\\t_XtTextReplace\\n\\n\\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\\n[10/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn\\'t my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\\n\\n\\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\\ncan use something like the following:\\n\\n        XWMHints wmhints;\\n        ...\\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\\n        wmhints.input = True;\\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\\n\\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \\nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don\\'t have\\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource \\'*input:True\\'.\\n\\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \\nthis done. \\n\\n\\tIf you are using Sun\\'s OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren\\'t ICCCM-compliant.\\n\\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\\n\\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\\n\\n\\tYou can\\'t reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\\nspoofed in any case. \\n\\tFor most cases, you shouldn\\'t care which window manager is running, so \\nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \\nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \\nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \\nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm\\'s push-pin menus) in order\\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \\nmanager\\'s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\\n\\t\\n\\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \\nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \\nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \\ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \\napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \\nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \\nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \\ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \\nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \\nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \\nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \\t[3/90]\\n\\n\\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \\nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \\nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\\n\\n\\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\\n\\t{\\n\\tArg args[3];\\n\\tint i;\\n\\tint sensitive;\\t\\t/* oops; wrong data type */\\n\\ti=0;\\n\\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\\n\\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\\n\\t...\\n\\t}\\n\\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \\ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \\ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \\nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \\nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget\\'s man page.\\n[11/90]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 117)  Why don\\'t XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re probably trying to use these functions from application code.\\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \\nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \\nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \\nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\\n\\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions\\' being called, your\\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \\nwidgets\\' data becoming corrupted.\\n\\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \\navoided; they shouldn\\'t be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 118)  Why isn\\'t there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\\n\\n\\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\\nthe \"new\" widget should be. Resources are typically set based on the location\\nin the instance hierarchy; what resources should change if the instance moves?\\nWhat should happen to the widget\\'s children? And by the time such semantics are\\ndefined, there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old \\nwidget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired \\nresources, as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in \\ncreating a new widget.\\n\\n\\tNote that reparenting is possible in the OI toolkit.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDavid B.

Some of the new issues deal with \\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\\nX\\nX\\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\\nX\\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\\nX\\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\\nX    might be \\'old\\' the next year.\\nX\\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\\nX\\nX\\t* look at the original source\\nX\\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#define\\' and \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* run it through a C beautifier\\nX\\t* examine the algorithm\\nX\\t* lint it\\nX\\t* compile it\\nX\\t* execute it\\nX\\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\\nX    \\'cleaned up\\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\\nX\\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\\nX    \\'strangest/most creative source layout\\' need not do as well as\\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\\nX\\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award \\'worst abuse of the\\nX    rules\\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\\nX\\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\\nX    annoy more than amuse.\\nX\\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \\'worst abuse of the rules\\'\\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\\nX\\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn\\'t work.\\nX\\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\\nX    working entry is best.\\nX\\nX\\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\\nX\\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become \\'old\\'.  We\\nX    tend to \\'see thru\\' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won\\'t go as far\\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\\nX\\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\\nX\\nX\\t#define d define\\nX\\t#d foo\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t expect this to turn into #define foo\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tj;\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t use such implicit type declaration\\nX\\tint k;\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tchar *c;\\nX\\ti[c];\\t\\t   <--- use c[i] instead\\nX\\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\\nX\\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\\nX    not portable and must not be used:\\nX\\nX\\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\\nX\\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\\nX\\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\\nX\\t* using va_list as a structure or union\\nX\\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **\\'s.\\nX\\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\\nX\\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\\nX    the leading \\'#\\' must be the first character on a line.  While some\\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \\'#\\', many do not.\\nX\\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\\nX\\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\\nX\\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\\nX\\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are very hardware specific\\nX\\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\\nX\\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\\nX\\t      code is likely not to be)\\nX\\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\\nX\\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \\'remark\\' header item)\\nX\\t* won\\'t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\\nX\\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\\nX\\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\\nX\\t* are longer than they need to be\\nX\\t* are similar to previous winners\\nX\\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\\nX\\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\\nX    \\'best one liner\\' category, we suggest that you format your program\\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\\nX\\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D\\'s to help out,\\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D\\'s in order to\\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\\nX\\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\\nX\\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the \\'smallest self-replicating\\'\\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of \\'smallest\\', lest we (or others)\\nX    know of a smaller one!\\nX\\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don\\'t\\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don\\'t depend\\nX    on color or a given size.  Don\\'t require backing store.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\\nX    Don\\'t use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    We like programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\\nX\\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\\nX\\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\\nX\\t* are portable\\nX\\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\\nX\\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\\nX\\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\\nX\\nX    Some types of programs can\\'t excel in some areas.  Of course, your\\nX    program doesn\\'t have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\\nX    areas really does help.\\nX\\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\\nX\\nX    Be creative!\\nX\\nX\\nXENTRY FORMAT:\\nX\\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\\nX\\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\\nX\\nX\\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\\nX\\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\\nX\\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\\nX\\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\\nX\\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\\nX\\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\\nX\\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\\nX    the entry against the size rules.\\nX\\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename\\nX    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition,\\nX    we use the name of the entry\\'s title, followed by an optional\\nX    digit in case of name conflicts.\\nX\\nX    If the above entry somehow won the \\'least likely to win\\' award,\\nX    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.\\nX\\nX    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source\\nX    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the\\nX    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful\\nX    if you did one of the following:\\nX\\nX\\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\\nX\\nX\\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example:\\nX\\nX\\t\\tcc prog.c -o special_name\\t\\tneed special binary\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\\t\\t\\tneed special source\\nX\\t\\tcp prog.c special_src.c\\nX\\t\\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_build\\t\\t\\tneed special build\\nX\\t\\ttail +4 build > special_build\\nX\\t\\tsh < special_build\\nX\\nX\\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of \\nX\\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \\nX\\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\\nX\\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\\nX    \\'hints\\' file.\\nX\\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\\nX\\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\\nX    have entry number 0.\\nX\\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don\\'t place text outside of the\\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren\\'t\\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\\nX\\nX\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\\t(not the address for\\nX\\tjudges@toad.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t submitting entries)\\nX    \\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.

An example of such a string is:\\nX\\nX\\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\\nX\\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.

To do so, set\\nX    the \\'fix\\' line in the ---entry--- section to \\'y\\' instead of \\'n\\'.\\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\\nX    replaced.\\nX\\nX\\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\\nX\\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\\nX\\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\\nX\\nX\\t---entry--- section\\nX\\tall ---author--- sections\\nX\\tall ---info--- sections\\nX\\t---build--- section\\nX\\t---program--- section\\nX\\tany other text, including the Email message headers\\nX\\nX    Prior to judging, the \\'any other text\\' file is scanned to be sure\\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\\nX\\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\\nX\\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\\nX    Because the main \\'prize\\' of winning is being announced, we make all\\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\\nX    winners at talks)\\nX\\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\\nX\\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\\nX\\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\\nX\\nX\\t* reading the ---entry--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\\nX\\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\\nX\\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\\nX\\nX\\t* linting the source\\nX\\t* compiling/building the source\\nX\\t* running the program\\nX\\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\\nX\\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\\nX\\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\\nX\\nX\\t* best small one line program\\nX\\t* best small program\\nX\\t* strangest/most creative source layout\\nX\\t* most useful obfuscated program\\nX\\t* best game that is obfuscated\\nX\\t* most creatively obfuscated program\\nX\\t* most deceptive C code\\nX\\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\\nX\\t* best abuse of ANSI C\\nX\\t* worst abuse of the rules\\nX\\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\\nX\\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?\\n\\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\\n     of these products.\\n\\n----------- End included article ----------- \\n',\n",

Certain algorythms (usually parallel search\\nalgorythms) can be very slow in software, yet can fly in custom hardware.\\nI have no proof of their employment in Clipper -- it is pure conjecture.  \\nHowever, as a software implementation of this cipher is something that its \\ndesigners would have been trying to avoid at all costs, then the inclusion \\nof such techniques seems credible.\\n\\nHmmm... I also wonder what Intergraph thinks about the use of the name\\n\"Clipper\" for this device. :)\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\nI hate to follow up to my own posting, but I should perhaps clarify\\nsome things so I won't get flamed.\\n\\nFirst of all, when I'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a\\n``breakthrough in factoring'', what I really mean is a breakthrough in\\nthe cryptanalysis of RSA.  I know that factoring and breaking RSA are\\nnot proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to\\nrepeat this every time.\\n\\nI also have to admit that I don't really know if the ``non-group''\\nproperty of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  I have\\nthought about it a little while, but I can't find a way that a\\ncryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  That, of course, means\\nnothing at all.\\n\\nThen I wrote,\\n\\n\\nWhat I meant was that as long as the only advantage of the\\ncryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have RSA for\\na long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be\\nbroken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people\\nwould simply use longer moduli.  Both users and cryptanalysts benefit\\nfrom better technology in the same way.\\n\\nHope this keeps the flames away...  Have fun.\\n\",\n",

If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in \\nSweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.\\nDeducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on\\nSwedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high\\nas Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the \"dynasty\" talk\\nisn\\'t completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an\\nadvantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,\\nwon\\'t have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably\\nplay the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the\\nNorth American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top \\nScandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a \\ncouple of years the same way Edmonton\\'s \"dynasty\" crumbled in the late \\'80s. \\nSome fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an \\nexclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all.

I am not\\n        convinced that they would adequately safeguard _this_\\n\\tinformation, since in any case requiring disclosure, there\\'s\\n      \\tlikely to be sigificant pressure for disclosure- possibly\\n \\t*wrongful* disclosure.\\n\\n\\t- GAO: perhaps.

       "  '\\nI am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things\\nseem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.\\nThe all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what\\nI have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)\\nagree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\\n\\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  \\'Court order required\\' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target\\'s knowlege.  Don\\'t give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon\\'t buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not \\'unlikely\\'\\nor \\'difficult\\'.\\n\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn\\'t have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a \\'master key\\'?  I sure don\\'t.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN\\'T\\nexist a \\'master key\\' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for \\'next time\\'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem \\'disruptive\\'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn\\'t it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor\\'s Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n\\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\\nevery room of one\\'s home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto \\'safeguards\\'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon\\'t work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this \\'crisis\\' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n\\'drastic action\\', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don\\'t buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated \\'respected experts\\' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a \\'master key\\' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn\\'t it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to \\'fight crime\\'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another \\'noble cause\\', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.

The whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows\\nyou to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo-\\nlogic question) is proof of a theology used.\\n \\n \\n \\nIt is an important question in the light of what for instance the\\npassage witrh Sodom and Gomorrha means. Either there is some connection\\nbetween the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of\\nit, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has\\none to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write\\nother books that convey the message better. You might answer that one\\ncan\\'t becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but\\nthat holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has\\nthe Bible still a special place? Can\\'t it be replaced somehow? Is it\\nok to bargain the dangerous content of the Bible against some other\\nmessage that is included as well?\\n \\n \\n(Deletion)\\n \\nSorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if\\none could not have a better system.\\n \\n(Deletion)\\n \\nIf we read two stories in the Bible, one that god commands people\\nto kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills\\nchildren directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that\\nchildren are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?\\n \\n \\nAnd the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important\\nin the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it\\ncan be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions\\nwith that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way,\\nand have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some\\ngod.',\n",

They certainly seem to vote that way.\\n\\nAccording to Jack Herer\\'s book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over\\nTWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the\\nmarijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own\\nbusiness and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves\\nthan users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under\\nthe \"War on Drugs\" campaign of \"zero tolerance\" due process protections\\nhave eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have\\nproliferated.

       "  '\\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\\n\\n\\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\\n\\n...\\n\\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \\nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\\nwould, I\\'m sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn\\'t\\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\\nkill people.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\\nof firearms don\\'t involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\\n\\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\\nthe best.[3]\\n\\n\\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\\naren\\'t deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn\\'t true to say that all of\\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\\n\\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\\ngovernment.\"\\n\\t- T. Jefferson.\\n\\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\\n\\n\\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\\npeople wouldn\\'t kill if they didn\\'t have a gun, feel free to present it.\\n\\n\\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\\nnever have to shoot a person, but I\\'ve had to kill a number of animals from\\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don\\'t want them to suffer any more than\\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\\nI don\\'t want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I\\'m\\nafter, but it doesn\\'t always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\\nparticularly handguns, haven\\'t used them much for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\\n\\t48700 deaths by auto\\n\\t11300 deaths by fall\\n\\t 5300 deaths by drowning\\n\\t 4800 deaths by fire\\n\\t 4400 deaths by poison\\n\\t 3200 deaths by food\\n\\t 1400 deaths by firearm\\n\\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n\\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\",\n",

For example, a majority\\ncould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.\\nand it would fly using the logic above.\\n\\nWhen government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,\\nthere is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis\\nis deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those\\nwho decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a\\nmajority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting\\nthe hangee.\\n\\nWhat the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the\\nlimitations on the government, probably because they know that the\\npeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind\\ntampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has\\nbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just\\nshows how gullible the people have become to \"I am from the government\\nand am here to help you sort of line\".  We have been lied to, fed\\nhalf truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control\\nlaws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on\\nforce, pure and simple.

The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don\\'t have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don\\'t ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]\\'\\' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\n* How do I recover from lost passwords in WordPerfect?\\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX?

Full\\n  descriptions are given in Bennett [BEN87] and Bergen and Caelli\\n  [BER91].\\n\\n  decrypt WordPerfect document files and I think I have a solution. \\n  There is a software company named: Accessdata (87 East 600 South,\\n  Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has a software package that will\\n  decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox\\n  files. The cost of the package is $185. Steep prices, but if you\\n  think your pw key is less than 10 characters, (or 10 char) give them a\\n  call and ask for the free demo disk. The demo disk will decrypt files\\n  that have a 10 char or less pw key.\\'\\'\\n\\n* How do I break a Vigenere (repeated-key) cipher?\\n\\n  A repeated-key cipher, where the ciphertext is something like the\\n  plaintext xor KEYKEYKEYKEY (and so on), is called a Vigenere cipher.\\n  If the key is not too long and the plaintext is in English, do the\\n  following: \\n\\n  1. Discover the length of the key by counting coincidences.\\n  (See Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].) Trying each displacement of\\n  the ciphertext against itself, count those bytes which are equal. \\n  If the two ciphertext portions have used the same key, something\\n  over 6% of the bytes will be equal. If they have used different\\n  key, then less than 0.4% will be equal (assuming random 8-bit bytes\\n  of key covering normal ASCII text). The smallest displacement which\\n  indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key.\\n\\n  2. Shift the text by that length and XOR it with itself. This\\n  removes the key and leaves you with text XORed with itself. Since\\n  English has about 1 bit of real information per byte, 2 streams of\\n  text XORed together has 2 bits of info per 8-bit byte, providing\\n  plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption. (And in fact\\n  one stream of text XORed with itself has just 1 bit per byte.)\\n\\n  If the key is short, it might be even easier to treat this as a\\n  standard polyalphabetic substitution. All the old cryptanalysis\\n  texts show how to break those. It\\'s possible with those methods, in\\n  the hands of an expert, if there\\'s only ten times as much text as key.\\n  See, for example, Gaines [GAI44], Sinkov [SIN66].\\n\\n* How do I send encrypted mail under UNIX? [PGP, RIPEM, PEM, ...]\\n\\n  Here\\'s one popular method, using the des command:\\n\\n    cat file | compress | des private_key | uuencode | mail\\n\\n  Meanwhile, there is a de jure Internet standard in the works called\\n  PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail). It is described in RFCs 1421 through\\n  1424. To join the PEM mailing list, contact pem-dev-request@tis.com.\\n  There is a beta version of PEM being tested at the time of this\\n  writing.\\n\\n  There are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting\\n  mail: PGP and RIPEM.  Both are available by FTP.  Each has its own\\n  newsgroup: alt.security.pgp and alt.security.ripem.  Each has its own FAQ\\n  as well.\\n\\n  PGP is most commonly used outside the USA since it uses the RSA algorithm\\n  without a license and RSA\\'s patent is valid only (or at least primarily)\\n  in the USA.\\n\\n  RIPEM is most commonly used inside the USA since it uses the RSAREF which\\n  is freely available within the USA but not available for shipment outside\\n  the USA.\\n\\n  Since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of\\n  the message (PGP used IDEA; RIPEM uses DES) and RSA for encrypting the\\n  message key, they should be able to interoperate freely.  Although there\\n  have been repeated calls for each to understand the other\\'s formats and\\n  algorithm choices, no interoperation is available at this time (as far as\\n  we know).\\n\\n* Is the UNIX crypt command secure?\\n\\n  No. See [REE84]. There is a program available called cbw (crypt\\n  breaker\\'s workbench) which can be used to do ciphertext-only attacks\\n  on files encrypted with crypt. One source for CBW is [FTPCB].\\n\\n* How do I use compression with encryption?\\n\\n  A number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by\\n  some simple encryption method (e.g., XOR with a repeated key).\\n\\n  Unfortunately, you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact\\n  distribution of possible inputs. For all practical purposes it\\'s\\n  impossible to describe ``the typical English text\\'\\' beyond coarse\\n  characteristics such as single-letter frequencies. You can build up\\n  more and more sophisticated models of your inputs, but if the enemy\\n  has a slightly more accurate model, he\\'ll be able to find some\\n  redundancy in your compressed output.\\n\\n  Note that nearly all practical compression schemes, unless they\\n  have been designed with cryptography in mind, produce output that\\n  actually starts off with high redundancy. For example, the output of\\n  UNIX compress begins with a well-known three-byte ``magic number\\'\\'\\n  that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis.\\n  \\n  This is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a\\n  bad idea; it just has to be done very, very carefully, and by no means\\n  removes the need for strong encryption.\\n\\n  Compression after encryption is silly.\\n\\n* Is there an unbreakable cipher?\\n\\n  Yes. The one-time pad is unbreakable; see part 4. Unfortunately the\\n  one-time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as\\n  plaintext.\\n\\n  Of course, a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be\\n  useful. Rather, it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by\\n  likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is\\n  expected to remain valid.\\n\\n* What does ``random\\'\\' mean in cryptography?\\n\\n  Cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom\\n  number generator than most applications. For a source of bits to be\\n  cryptographically random, it must be computationally impossible to\\n  predict what the Nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of\\n  the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of\\n  0th through N-1st bits, for all N up to the lifetime of the source.\\n\\n  A software generator (also known as pseudo-random) has the function\\n  of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently\\n  random bits.  This seed must be large enough not to be guessed by\\n  the opponent.  Ideally, it should also be truly random (perhaps\\n  generated by a hardware random number source).\\n\\n  Those who have Sparcstation 1 workstations could, for example,\\n  generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of\\n  entropy, by not connecting anything to it.  For example,\\n\\n\\tcat /dev/audio | compress - >foo\\n\\n  gives a file of high entropy (not random but with much randomness in\\n  it).  One can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key,\\n  for example, to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo-random\\n  string.\\n\\n  When looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy, it is\\n  important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that\\n  because it looks complicated to a human, it must be \"random\".  For\\n  example, disk operation completion times sound like they might be\\n  unpredictable (to many people) but a spinning disk is much like a\\n  clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy.\\n\\n* What is the unicity point (a.k.a. unicity distance)?\\n\\n  See [SHA49]. The unicity distance is an approximation to that amount\\n  of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information (entropy) in\\n  the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number\\n  of ciphertext bits used. Ciphertexts significantly longer than this\\n  can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment. This is used to\\n  back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext-only cryptanalysis. \\n  Ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have\\n  multiple, equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security\\n  from the opponent\\'s difficulty choosing the correct one.\\n\\n  Unicity distance, like all statistical or information-theoretic\\n  measures, does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives\\n  probabilistic results: namely, the minimum amount of ciphertext\\n  for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible\\n  plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext, when all possible keys\\n  are tried for the decryption. Working cryptologists don\\'t normally\\n  deal with unicity distance as such. Instead they directly determine\\n  the likelihood of events of interest.\\n\\n  Let the unicity distance of a cipher be D characters. If fewer than\\n  D ciphertext characters have been intercepted, then there is not\\n  enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of\\n  possible keys. DES has a unicity distance of 17.5 characters,\\n  which is less than 3 ciphertext blocks (each block corresponds to\\n  8 ASCII characters). This may seem alarmingly low at first, but\\n  the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work\\n  required to find the key after approximately D characters have been\\n  intercepted.\\n\\n  In fact, actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used\\n  in discussing unicity distance. (Like other measures such as key\\n  size, unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if\\n  it\\'s too small, but doesn\\'t guarantee security if it\\'s high.) Few\\n  practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis; all\\n  manner of characteristics might serve as entering ``wedges\\'\\' to crack\\n  some cipher messages. However, similar information-theoretic\\n  considerations are occasionally useful, for example, to determine a\\n  recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem.\\n  Cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and\\n  information-theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most\\n  promising directions.\\n\\n  Unfortunately, most literature on the application of information\\n  statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified, even the seminal\\n  1940 work of Alan Turing (see [KOZ84]). For some insight into the\\n  possibilities, see [KUL68] and [GOO83].\\n\\n* What is key management and why is it important?\\n\\n  One of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in\\n  full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system,\\n  and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption. (Of\\n  course, one would assume that the CIA does not make a habit of telling\\n  Mossad about its cryptosystems, but Mossad probably finds out anyway.)\\n  Repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can\\n  eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress. Thus, especially in\\n  modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are\\n  transferred, both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but\\n  also enough key material to cover the traffic.\\n\\n  Key management refers to the distribution, authentication, and\\n  handling of keys.\\n\\n  A publicly accessible example of modern key management technology\\n  is the STU III secure telephone unit, which for classified use\\n  employs individual coded ``Crypto Ignition Keys\\'\\' and a central Key\\n  Management Center operated by NSA. There is a hierarchy in that\\n  certain CIKs are used by authorized cryptographic control\\n  personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and\\n  to perform installation/maintenance functions, such as the\\n  reporting of lost CIKs.\\n\\n  This should give an inkling of the extent of the key management\\n  problem. For public-key systems, there are several related issues,\\n  many having to do with ``whom do you trust?\\'\\'\\n\\n* Can I use pseudo-random or chaotic numbers as a key stream?\\n\\n  Chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from\\n  relatively compact generators. Perhaps the simplest example is a\\n  linear congruential sequence, one of the most popular types of random\\n  number generators, where there is no obvious dependence between seeds\\n  and outputs. Unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will, in a\\n  high enough dimension, show up as a regular lattice. Mathematically\\n  this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for\\n  cryptanalysts to exploit. More complicated generators have more\\n  complicated structure, which is why they make interesting pictures---\\n  but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable\\n  structure at all.\\n\\n  See [KNU81], exercise 3.5-7; [REE77]; and [BOY89].\\n\\n* What is the correct frequency list for English letters?\\n\\n  There are three answers to this question, each slightly deeper than\\n  the one before. You can find the first answer in various books:\\n  namely, a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of\\n  English text. Of course any such list will be ``correctly\\'\\' computed,\\n  but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken.\\n\\n  The second answer is that the question doesn\\'t make sense. What do\\n  you mean by ``English letters\\'\\'? The ``English language\\'\\' is not a\\n  fixed, finite, closed object that can be exactly characterized. It\\n  has changed over time; it is different between different authors.\\n  Any particular message will have different statistics from those of\\n  the language as a whole.\\n\\n  The third answer is that yes, no particular message is going to have\\n  exactly the same characteristics as English in general, but for all\\n  reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won\\'t matter.\\n  In fact there\\'s an entire field called ``Bayesian statistics\\'\\' (other\\n  buzzwords are ``maximum entropy methods\\'\\' and ``maximum likelihood\\n  estimation\\'\\') which studies questions like ``What\\'s the chance that a\\n  text with these letter frequencies is in English?\\'\\' and comes up with\\n  reasonably robust answers.\\n\\n  So make your own list from your own samples of English text. It will\\n  be good enough for practical work, if you use it properly.\\n\\n* What is the Enigma?\\n\\n  ``For a project in data security we are looking for sources of\\n  information about the German Enigma code and how it was broken by\\n  the British during WWII.\\'\\'\\n\\n  See [WEL82], [DEA85], [KOZ84], [HOD83], [KAH91].\\n\\n* How do I shuffle cards?\\n\\n  Card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of\\n  values, using a random or pseudo-random function.  All possible output\\n  permutations of this process should be equally likely.  To do this, you\\n  need a random function (modran(x)) which will produce a uniformly\\n  distributed random integer in the interval [0..x-1].  Given that\\n  function, you can shuffle with the following [C] code: (assuming ARRLTH\\n  is the length of array arr[] and swap() interchanges values at the two\\n  addresses given)\\n\\n  for ( n = ARRLTH-1; n > 0 ; n-- ) swap( &arr[modran( n+1 )], &arr[n] ) ;\\n\\n  modran(x) can not be achieved exactly with a simple (ranno() % x) since\\n  ranno()\\'s interval may not be divisible by x, although in most cases the\\n  error will be very small.  To cover this case, one can take ranno()\\'s\\n  modulus mod x, call that number y, and if ranno() returns a value less\\n  than y, go back and get another ranno() value.\\n\\n\\n* Can I foil S/W pirates by encrypting my CD-ROM?\\n\\n  Someone will frequently express the desire to publish a CD-ROM with\\n  possibly multiple pieces of software, perhaps with each encrypted\\n  separately, and will want to use different keys for each user (perhaps\\n  even good for only a limited period of time) in order to avoid piracy.\\n\\n  As far as we know, this is impossible, since there is nothing in standard\\n  PC or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the\\n  keyboard.  If there were such an identification, then the CD-ROM could be\\n  encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in\\n  part on the unique identifier.  However, in this case the CD-ROM is one\\n  of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose.\\n\\n  If the CD-ROM is to be encrypted once and then mass produced, there must\\n  be a key (or set of keys) for that encryption produced at some stage in\\n  the process.

The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.

But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.

Who would\\nhave thought?\\n\\n\\n\\tI remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5\\' a reasonable space\\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5\\' restriction, or the possibility\\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\\n\\n\\n\\tI disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\\nweapons aren\\'t commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe have to assume that there would be those who would\\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they\\'ve all\\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\\nI\\'d like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\\nlocal troups having a few 105\\'s and anti-tank weapons in their\\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.  The Federal army, I\\'m convinced, should have a\\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\\nfor these functions.',\n",

Traditionally, auditors do not like to get\\ninvolved in the design or operational aspects of things, and with good\\nreason.\\n\\nWhen I was a systems programmer, it always infuriated me that the\\nauditors would come in and tell us our implementation stunk from a\\nsecurity point of view, but wouldn\\'t tell us how to fix it.  I always\\nfigured they just liked to critcize, without doing the work to help fix\\nthe problem.\\n\\nThen I took a stint as an auditor, and I found out the real reason.\\nAuditors don\\'t like to recommend solutions, because it puts them in a\\nbad position if they have to criticize the implementation later.  The\\nauditee can say, \"Well, you told us this way would be OK.\"  It\\ncompromises the independence that is a necessary part of the auditor\\'s\\njob.\\n\\nTaking the case at hand, suppose ACLU becomes a key half registrar.\\nSuppose that, perhaps through some error on ACLU\\'s part, a key half gets\\naway that shouldn\\'t, and is used to deprive someone of her civil\\nliberties.  The ACLU gets wind of this, and wants to take it to court.\\nBut they end up being at the same time on the side of the defendant\\nand of the plaintiff, which is not an easy position to be in.\\n\\nThere are exceptions to the complete independence of auditors: at one\\nplace where I worked, when payroll checks were printed, they were signed\\nautomatically by a signature drum on the bursting machine.  This drum\\nwas kept by the auditors (who also kept the check stock), and\\nwas brought down to Data Processing when it was time to do the checks.\\n\\nI believe the difference between this situation and the key registration\\nsituation is that it is fairly obvious when it is time to do the payroll\\nchecks:  if they were done yesterday, and someone wants to do them again\\ntoday, he better be able to produce yesterday\\'s checks so that they can\\nbe destroyed.  Determining which of the many requests for key halves are\\nlegit is a trickier process, one much more prone to mistakes that could\\nput the ACLU in a protecting-the-client versus protecting-the-ACLU\\nconflict of interest.\\n\\nAs always, my opinions are my own.',\n",

       "  ' \\n: There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\\n: that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\\n\\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\\nspiritual explanations. \\n\\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn\\'t: it is self-\\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \\n\\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\\n\\n There is no need\\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\n: determnined.\\n\\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\\nwill or not? \\n\\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\n: acquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident.\\n\\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \\nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\\nsurvive, those which don\\'t don\\'t make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\\n\\n: For an atheist, no\\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\n: an event can have value. \\n\\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \\n\\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\\nfor starters.\\n\\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\n: establish your values.\\n\\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\\nseverely flawed.\\n\\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\\'s\\nown people.\\n\\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nations. \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\\n\\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n: - that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt looks like you haven\\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\'s happiness, too, if the observer\\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\\nmeaning. \\n\\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \\npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\\ndo not exist. \\n\\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\\'\\nexistence.\\n\\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \\n\\n: That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n: or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\n\\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\\n\\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\\ncease to be subjective. \\n\\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \\ninherently subjective. \\n\\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\\nwe don\\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\\'s\\nown and then to get mad at this. \\n\\nGod must be schizophrenic.\\n\\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\n: weight whatsoever.\\n\\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\\n\\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \\n\\nPetri\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nYou misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about\\nhis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book\\n\"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,\\nnot a Muslim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Bernard Lewis:\\n\\nHim being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his\\ngiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.\\n\\nRead \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.\\n\\nIn fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn\\'t too long).\\n\\n\\nI haven\\'t read Lewis\\'s article, so I can\\'t comment directly upon it, and\\nhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his\\npolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic\\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\\non telling half-truths.\\n\\nAgain, read \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.',\n",

Helsingius?\\n\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n\\nIDENTITY\\n========\\n\\n_____\\n<1.1> What is `identity' on the internet?\\n\\n  Generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily\\n  determined by their email address in the sense that this is their\\n  most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   This is your\\n  login name qualified by the complete address domain information,\\n  for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  People see\\n  this address when receiving mail or reading USENET posts from you\\n  and in other situations where programs record usage.  Some obsolete\\n  forms of addresses (such as BITNET) still persist.\\n\\n  In email messages, additional information on the path that a message\\n  takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  This\\n  information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the\\n  transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  This\\n  type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the USENET\\n  protocol to a lesser extent.  Forging these fields requires\\n  corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and\\n  is very uncommon.  Not so uncommon is forging the chain at the\\n  origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked\\n  at the time the message is created.  Tracing these messages can be\\n  difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of\\n  real machines and represent real transfer routes.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.2> Why is identity (un)important on the internet?\\n\\n  The concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,\\n  privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of\\n  computer networks. For example, the convenience of communication\\n  afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for\\n  identification.  But there are many potential abuses of identity\\n  possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive\\n  computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can\\n  potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.\\n\\n  Verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',\\n  and one classic example of the problems associated with it is\\n  H.G.Well's ``War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled\\n  segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was\\n  in progress.  Hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on Usenet and\\n  forged identities makes them more insidious.  People and their\\n  reputations can be assaulted by forgery.\\n\\n  However, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of\\n  its most attractive features. Identity is just as useful as it is\\n  harmful.  A professor might carefully explain a topic until he\\n  finds he is talking to an undergraduate. A person of a particular\\n  occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally\\n  shun him.  Some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many\\n  prejudices are useful!  A scientist might argue he can better\\n  evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more\\n  about the authors.  Likewise, he may be more likely to reject it\\n  based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  On the other side of the\\n  connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in\\n  exerting pressure for acceptance.\\n\\n  Identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating\\n  `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. \\n  Many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques\\n  for identification. Heavy reliance will be placed on digital\\n  authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. \\n  Many government functions and services are based on identification,\\n  and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  Hence, employees of\\n  many government organizations push toward stronger identification\\n  structures.  But when does identification invade privacy?\\n\\n  The growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive\\n  proportions. Decisions made now on issues of identity will affect\\n  many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly\\n  global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or\\n  adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will\\n  literally be magnified exponentially.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.3> How does my email address (not) identify me and my background?\\n\\n  Your email address may contain information that influences people's\\n  perceptions of your background.  The address may `identify' you as\\n  from a department at a particular university, an employee at a\\n  company, or a government worker.  It may contain your last name,\\n  initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  In\\n  the US some are based on parts of social security numbers.  Others\\n  are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the\\n  order that new users are added to the system.\\n\\n  Standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your\\n  broad geographical location or nationhood.  However, none of this\\n  information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  The\\n  fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on\\n  rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network\\n  cabling distributions.  The only point to make is that early fields\\n  in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names\\n  or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as\\n  continental domains).  Typically the first field is the name of the\\n  computer receiving mail.\\n\\n  Gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an\\n  inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (For more\\n  information, see the FAQs on email  addresses and known\\n  geographical distributions below.)  However, UNIX utilities exist\\n  to aid in the quest (see the question on this).\\n\\n  Common Suffixes\\n  ---------------\\n\\n  .us    United States\\n  .uk    United Kingdom\\n  .ca    Canada\\n  .fi    Finland\\n  .au    Australia\\n\\n  .edu   university or college\\n  .com   commercial organization\\n  .org   'other' (e.g. nonprofit organization)\\n  .gov   government\\n  .mil   military site\\n \\n_____\\n<1.4> How can I find out more about somebody with a given email address?\\n\\n  One simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  Another\\n  way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.\\n  postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help\\n  find user ID's of particular people given their real name and solve\\n  mail routing problems.  The sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also\\n  be able to supply information.  Users with related email address\\n  may have information.  However, all of these methods rely on the\\n  time and patience of others so use them minimally.\\n\\n  One of the most basic tools for determining identity over the\\n  internet is the UNIX utility 'finger'.  The basic syntax is:\\n\\n    finger user@here.there.everywhere\\n\\n  This utility uses communication protocols to query the computer\\n  named in the address for information on the user named.  The\\n  response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may\\n  be in any format.  Possible responses are as follows:\\n\\n  - A message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is\\n    incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.\\n  \\n  - A message 'In real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer\\n    could not find any kind of a match on the username. The finger\\n    utility may return this response in other situations.\\n  \\n  - A listing of information associated with multiple users. Some\\n    computers will search only for matching user IDs, others will\\n    attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all\\n    actual full names of users kept in a local database.\\n  \\n  At some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the\\n  system with a `finger @address'.  In general this is often\\n  considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid\\n  user ID's to `crack' passwords.\\n\\n  More information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. \\n  More information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses\\n  is given in the email FAQ (such as the WHOIS lookup utility).  Just\\n  as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use\\n  them to find out about you.  You can `finger' yourself to find out\\n  what is publicly reported by your UNIX system about you.  Be\\n  careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with\\n  internet access worldwide can query this information.  In one\\n  amazing case, the New York Times writer J. Markoff uncovered the\\n  identity of R. Morris, author of the Internet Worm,  through\\n  the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  See the book Cyberspace\\n  by K. Hafner and J. Markoff.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.5> Why is identification (un)stable on the internet?\\n\\n  Generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept\\n  on the Internet for a variety of reasons.  One is the inherent\\n  fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge\\n  frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. \\n  Most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual\\n  identification in the 'real world'.  The arbitary and cryptic \\n  sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are\\n  not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique\\n  identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on\\n  multiple machines anywhere in the world.\\n\\n  Currently internet users do not really have any great assurances\\n  that the messages in email and USENET are from who they appear to\\n  be. A person's mailing address is far from an identification of an\\n  individual.  \\n  \\n  - Anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,\\n    either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address\\n    in the From: line.\\n  \\n  - Email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as\\n    they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. \\n\\n  - As part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the From:\\n    line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many\\n    hackers.\\n    \\n  The status and path information prepended to messages by\\n  intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. In general, while\\n  possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in\\n  email.  Besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic\\n  problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification\\n  on the internet:\\n\\n  - Internet mail standards, described in RFC-822, are still evolving\\n    rapidly and not entirely orderly.  For example, standards for\\n    mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between\\n    sites and frequently mean the difference between finding\\n    addresses and bouncing mail.\\n  \\n  - Domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,\\n    and there are delays in the propagation of this data.\\n  \\n  - Addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers\\n    crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved\\n    in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. \\n  \\n  - A whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if\\n    they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even\\n    the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different\\n    interpretations at different sites.\\n  \\n  The current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly\\n  anachronistic in that they were created when the network was\\n  somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the\\n  traffic it now sees.  Today a large proportion of internet traffic\\n  is email, comprising  millions of messages.\\n\\n_____\\n<1.6> What is the future of identification on the internet?\\n\\n  Some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images\\n  and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of\\n  community that comes from the familiarity of identification.\\n  However, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts\\n  of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises\\n  in privacy.\\n\\n  Promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'\\n  and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  Also, the trend\\n  in USENET standards is toward greater authentication of posted\\n  information.  On the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity\\n  (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  See below.\\n\\n\\nPRIVACY\\n=======\\n\\n_____\\n<2.1> What is `privacy' on the internet?\\n\\n  Generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and\\n  perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to\\n  mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the\\n  data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do\\n  not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  In other words, \\n  others may obtain data associated with your account, but not\\n  without your permission.  These ideas are probably both fairly\\n  limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users\\n  consider their private domains.  Some users don't expect or want\\n  any privacy, some expect and demand it.\\n\\n_____\\n<2.2> Why is privacy (un)important on the internet?\\n\\n  This is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing\\n  passionate opinions.  On the internet, some take privacy for\\n  granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.\\n  Most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the\\n  illegal search and seizure clause of the U.S. constitution, adopted\\n  by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws\\n  prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). These\\n  rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules\\n  governing it.  However, the legal repercussions of the global\\n  internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong\\n  legal precedents and court cases).  The fact that internet traffic\\n  frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not\\n  centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly\\n  discourages its regulation.\\n\\n_____\\n<2.3> How (in)secure are internet networks?\\n\\n  - `Theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with\\n    access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the\\n    Internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. However, the\\n    sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes\\n    these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies\\n    with supposedly vast funding and resources.\\n  \\n  - Technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by\\n    electrical wires without detection.  Less obscurely, any machine\\n    with a network connection is a potential station for traffic\\n    detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to\\n    very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even\\n    possible.\\n  \\n  - A company Network General Inc. is one of many that manufactures\\n    and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can\\n    'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for\\n    troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is\\n    prohibitive for casual use.\\n\\n  Known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major\\n  scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. The greatest risks\\n  tend to emerge locally.  Note that all these approaches are almost\\n  completely defused with the use of cryptography.\\n    \\n_____\\n<2.4> How (in)secure is my account?\\n\\n  By default, not very.  There are a multitude of factors that may\\n  reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. \\n  First, your account must be secure from other users. The universal\\n  system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to\\n  guess) this security is significantly diminished.  Somewhat\\n  surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the\\n  system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited\\n  access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to\\n  others.  This means that they may read any file in your account\\n  without detection.\\n\\n  Furthermore, not universally known, most UNIX systems keep fairly\\n  extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what\\n  commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login\\n  information is usually public). Most features of this `auditing' or\\n   `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the\\n  initial installation and the system administrator may customize it\\n  to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. \\n  This information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting\\n  purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  This data tracks\\n  unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on\\n  the system. A traditional part of the UNIX system that tracks user\\n  commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of\\n  symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').\\n  \\n  UNIX implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features\\n  and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies\\n  regularly. Typically system adminstrators augment the basic UNIX\\n  functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed\\n  tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'\\n  activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect\\n  login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).\\n  \\n  Generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for\\n  various reasons:\\n  \\n  - Potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by\\n    someone else. \\n\\n  - System administrators make extensive backups that are completely\\n    invisible to users which may record the states of an account over\\n    many weeks. \\n\\n  - Erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. \\n\\n  - Most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or\\n    otherwise; for example FTP sites usually log the commands and\\n    record the domain originations of users, including anonymous\\n    ones.\\n\\n  - Some software exacerbates these problems.  See the section on\\n    ``X Windows (in)security''.\\n\\n  Indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much\\n  more commonly harmful threat. There are multiple ways to help\\n  ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and\\n  compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:\\n\\n  - Choose a secure password.  Change it periodically.\\n  - Make sure to logout always.\\n  - Do not leave a machine unattended for long.\\n  - Make sure no one watches you when you type your password.\\n  - Avoid password references in email.\\n  - Be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.\\n  - Use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be\\n    considerate.\\n\\n  Be wary of situations where you think you should supply your\\n  password.  There are only several basic situations where UNIX\\n  prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or\\n  changing your password.  Situations can arise in which prompts for\\n  passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you\\n  are talking to them (such as Internet Relay Chat).  Also, be  aware\\n  that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain \\n  passwords.\\n\\n\\n  (Thanks to Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu> for contributions\\n  here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<2.5> How (in)secure are my files and directories?\\n\\n  The most important privacy considerations are related to file\\n  rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature\\n  or haphazard maintenance. Be aware of the rights associated with\\n  your files and directories in UNIX. If the `x' (`execute') right on\\n  your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these\\n  users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. \\n  Anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete\\n  files in your home directory. The rights on a directory supersede\\n  the rights associated with files in that directory. For a\\n  directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)\\n  in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  To list\\n  the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.\\n \\n  By default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the\\n  initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator\\n  preference.  The default file mode specifies the initial rights\\n  associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell\\n  with `umask'.  The details of rights implementations tend to vary\\n  between versions of UNIX.  Consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.\\n\\n  Examples\\n  --------\\n\\n    traver.lance % ls -ld ~\\n    drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 Jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/\\n\\n  Here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home\\n  directory, denoted by `~'.  The columns at the left identify what\\n  rights are available. The first column identifies the entry as a\\n  directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and\\n  execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  For\\n  directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and\\n  subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. The\\n  subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to\\n  anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  They\\n  can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy\\n  is completely invisible to them.\\n\\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\\n    -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\\n    traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg\\n    traver.lance % ls -l msg\\n    -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 Jan 29 23:13 msg\\n\\n  Here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights\\n  from `group' and `other'. \\n  \\n  Note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list\\n  of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files\\n  and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. For example,\\n  suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following\\n  is possible:\\n\\n    ls foo\\n\\n  These commands would fail independent of file rights:\\n  \\n    ls -l foo\\n    ls -l foo/file\\n    cat foo/file\\n    cd foo\\n\\n  If the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are\\n  possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'\\n  readable file named `file':\\n  \\n    ls -l foo/file\\n    cat foo/file\\n    cd foo\\n  \\n  The following commands fail:\\n  \\n    ls foo\\n    ls -l foo\\n  \\n\\n  (Thanks to Uwe Waldmann <uwe@mpi-sb.mpg.de> for contributions here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<2.6> How (in)secure is X Windows?\\n\\n  X Windows is the primary software developed by the MIT Athena\\n  project which is funded by U.S. government grants to develop\\n  applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing\\n  computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. \\n  The software implements a client-server interface to a computer via\\n  graphical windows. In this case the `client' is the application\\n  requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a\\n  mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  In many\\n  situations the client is an application program running on the same\\n  machine as the server.\\n\\n  The great utility of X Windows comes from its complete dissociation\\n  of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a\\n  server at a remote location from the  client. Unfortunately this\\n  dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated\\n  security considerations.  The primary security and privacy issue\\n  associated with X Windows is that much more sensitive data may be\\n  sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where\\n  the human is situated near the host computer.  Currently there is\\n  no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in X\\n  Windows.\\n\\n  Due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design\\n  flaws,  early versions of the X Window system are extremely\\n  insecure. Anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt\\n  that display or read it electronically based on access to the\\n  device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   There are no protections\\n  from this type of access in these versions.   The problem arises\\n  because the security is completely based on machine addresses\\n  rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is\\n  himself trusted. Quoting from X documentation (man Xsecurity):\\n  \\n  > Any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed\\n  > access to the X server. This system can work reasonably well in\\n  > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a\\n  > single person can log into a given machine...This system does not\\n  > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and\\n  > mutual trust does not exist. \\n  \\n  With the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some\\n  naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0\\n  evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost\\n  +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an\\n  authorized client machine. By default clients running nonlocal to\\n  the host are disabled.  Public domain programs to disrupt a display\\n  momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or\\n  cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on\\n  the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks\\n  on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  Much more serious security\\n  breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this\\n  inherent weaknesses.  (The minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'\\n  security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``X\\n  Hanging Open, Security Terrible.''). \\n\\n  New versions of the X Window system (X11R5 and higher) by default \\n  make server access as secure as the file system using a .Xauthority\\n  file and 'magic cookies'.  Remote machines must have a code in the\\n  .Xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code\\n  allowed by the server.  Many older programs and even new\\n  vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with\\n  `magic cookies'. The basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to\\n  monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of\\n  keys occurs in transmission.  X11R5 also includes other\\n  sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  Try `man Xsecurity' to find\\n  out what is supported at your site.  Even though improved security \\n  mechanisms have been available in X Windows since ~1990, local\\n  sites often update this software infrequently because installation\\n  is extremely complex.\\n\\n\\n  (Thanks to Marc Vanheyningen <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu>, \\n  Jim Mattson <mattson@cs.ucsd.edu>, and Bill Marshall\\n  <marshall@cs.iastate.edu> for contributions here.)\\n\\n_____\\n<2.7> How (in)secure is my email?\\n\\n  By default, not very.  The characters that you are reading are\\n  almost certainly encoded in ASCII, the American Standard Code for\\n  Information Interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic\\n  characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  Virtually every\\n  computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting\\n  to and from it.  When you write a mail message, by default it is\\n  being sent in ASCII,  and since the standard is virtually\\n  universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  Despite milleniums worth\\n  of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies\\n  are only recently being established that afford high priority to\\n  privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  Some\\n  potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:\\n\\n  - The most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous\\n    system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a\\n    local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),\\n    such as a university. \\n  \\n  - System administrators may also release files to law enforcement\\n    agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving\\n    computer searches have still not been strongly established and\\n    tested legally.\\n\\n  - Note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in\\n    their entirety.  This means that if you address mail with an\\n    incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human\\n    other than the recipient.\\n\\n  - Typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local\\n    mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be\\n    overridden.\\n\\n  - Finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of \\n    everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail \\n    routing software mechanisms.  This `feature' can be disabled.\\n\\n  Most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly\\n  avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has\\n  its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators\\n  may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or\\n  nonlocal).  See the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email\\n  policies.''\\n\\n_____\\n<2.8> How am I (not) liable for my email and postings?\\n\\n  As punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke\\n  certain `privileges' such as emailing, USENET posting or reading\\n  certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or\\n  generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. \\n  This all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator\\n  and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in\\n  many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  Currently there are\\n  virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for\\n  restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators\\n  are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.\\n\\n  Today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.\\n  In the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator\\n  regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by\\n  complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's\\n  objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to USENET are\\n  usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as\\n  urged by others on the `net'. (The debate persists endlessly on\\n  many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means\\n  of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring\\n  unpopular opinions.)\\n  \\n  System administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to\\n  'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  In general, however, by tradition\\n  Usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of\\n  the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe\\n  their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options\\n  wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next\\n  message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'\\n  annoying posters (according to the Hacker's Dictionary, the sound a\\n  jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).\\n\\n  In cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system\\n  administrators are least likely to restrict email.  USENET postings\\n  are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or \\n  entire groups (such as a university campus).  Restrictions are most\\n  commonly associated with the following `abuses':\\n\\n  - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'\\n  - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material\\n  - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the\\n    poster instead of citing the content of the message\\n  - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness\\n  - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups\\n    `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive\\n    files\\n\\n  Major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and\\n  official email or postings.  Most users have internet access via\\n  accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the\\n  internet can be construed as representative of their parent\\n  organizations. Many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in\\n  an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent\\n  organizations as a precaution. A recent visible political case\\n  involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by White House\\n  staff members of the Bush administration.  Following are some\\n  guidelines:\\n\\n  - Acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.\\n  - If possible, avoid use of your company email address for private\\n    communication.\\n  - Use a disclaimer.\\n  - Keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).\\n  - Avoid posting information that could be  construed to be\\n    proprietary or `internal'.\\n\\n  The following references are available from ftp.eff.com\\n  (see also the section on ``internet use policies''):\\n\\n  /pub/academic/banned.1991\\n  /pub/academic/banned.1992\\n  ---\\n    Computer material that was banned/challenged in academia in 1991\\n    and 1992 including USENET hierarchies.\\n\\n  /pub/academic/cases\\n  ---\\n    This is an on-line collection of information about specific\\n    computers and academic freedom cases. File README is a detailed\\n    description of the items in the directory.\\n\\n  /pub/academic/faq/netnews.liability\\n  ---\\n    Notes on university liability for Usenet.\\n\\n_____\\n<2.9> How do I provide more/less information to others on my identity?\\n\\n  The public information of your identity and account is mostly\\n  available though the UNIX utility `finger' described above. \\n  \\n  - You have control over most of this information with the utility\\n    `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use\\n    `passwd -f').\\n   \\n  - You can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is\\n    copied directly to the destination during the fingering. \\n    \\n  - A technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is\\n    'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.\\n    \\n  - Your signature is determined by the environment variable SIGNATURE\\n    \\n  - USENET signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file\\n    in your home directory.\\n    \\n  Providing less information on your online identity is more difficult\\n  and involved.  One approach is to ask your system adminstrator to\\n  change or delete information about you (such as your full name). \\n  You may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from\\n  someone unrelated to you personally.  You may be able to remotely\\n  login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not\\n  physically near.  These are tactics for hiding or masking your\\n  online activities but nothing is foolproof.  Consult man pages on\\n  the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  Generally, files on\\n  a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very\\n  little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.\\n\\n  To mask your identity in email or on USENET you can use different\\n  accounts. More untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and\\n  remailing services that are very recently being established.  See\\n  below.\\n\\n______\\n<2.10> Who is my sysadmin?  What does s/he know about me?\\n\\n  The requirements and screening for getting a system administration\\n  job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely\\n  between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at\\n  universities.  Many UNIX systems at universities are largely\\n  managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often\\n  `hacking'.  In general, commercial and industrial sites are more\\n  strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are\\n  extremely strict.\\n\\n  The system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you\\n  used and at what times.  S/he may have a record (backups) of files\\n  on your account over a few weeks. S/he can monitor when  you send\\n  email or post USENET messages, and potentially read either.  S/he\\n  may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,\\n  both locally and elsewhere.  Administrators sometimes employ\\n  specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,\\n  which can potentially be misused.\\n\\n______\\n<2.11> Why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?\\n\\n  For the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an\\n  expectation with current use of the internet.  Furthermore, large\\n  parts of the internet are funded by the U.S. NSF (National Science\\n  Foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as\\n  prohibiting commercial use).  Some high-level officials in this and\\n  other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to\\n  guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).\\n\\n  Historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been\\n  local. Perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread\\n  occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some\\n  portion of USENET newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. The\\n  `alternative' hierarchy in the USENET system, which has virtually\\n  no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is\\n  frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).\\n\\n  From the global point of view traffic is generally completely\\n  unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders\\n  are pursued.  For example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted\\n  material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to\\n  USENET with regularity without major consequences (some email\\n  complaints may ensue).  More astonishing to some is that currently\\n  significant portions of USENET traffic, and less so internet\\n  traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost\\n  entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as\\n  `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).\\n  \\n______\\n<2.12> What is the future of privacy on the internet?\\n\\n  Some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or\\n  appropriate level of privacy.  Others will argue that as a\\n  prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate\\n  safeguards.  The internet is growing to become a completely global,\\n  international superhighway for data, and this traffic will\\n  inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and\\n  many other items of extremely personal nature. Computer items that\\n  many people consider completely private (such as their local hard\\n  drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.\\n  Also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged\\n  over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with\\n  the internet.\\n  \\n  Most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the\\n  internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to\\n  ensure much privacy. New standards are calling for uniform\\n  introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (PEM) which uses encryption\\n  technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is\\n  automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.\\n\\n  The same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy\\n  (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly\\n  effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). Some government\\n  agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe\\n  that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct\\n  (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  However, powerful new\\n  technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming\\n  increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out\\n  of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  In\\n  less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong\\n  cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically\\n  unstoppable.\\n  \\n  To date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure\\n  communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two\\n  goals are largely incompatible). Proposals for ``registration'' of\\n  secret keys (by D. Denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met\\n  with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,\\n  mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections\\n  of inherent feasibility.  Electronic privacy issues, and\\n  particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will\\n  foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few\\n  years.\\n\\n\\nANONYMITY\\n=========\\n\\n_____\\n<3.1> What is `anonymity' on the internet?\\n\\n  Simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the\\n  ultimate in privacy. However, there are several variations on\\n  this simple theme.  A person may wish to be consistently\\n  identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a\\n  reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.\\n  A person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single\\n  one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). Or, a person may\\n  wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with\\n  others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an\\n  `anonymous return address'.  A user may wish to appear as a\\n  `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  Sometimes a user\\n  wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the\\n  message itself). The anonymous item itself may be directed at\\n  individuals or groups.  A user may wish to access some\\n  service and hide all  signs of the association. \\n  \\n  All of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently\\n  tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking\\n  mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. \\n  Officials of the NSF and other government agencies may be opposed\\n  to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. \\n  Nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will\\n  always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.2> Why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?\\n\\n  Anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or\\n  problematic depending on its use.  Arguably absence of\\n  identification is important as the presence of it.  It may be the\\n  case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be\\n  discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true\\n  anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.\\n\\n  One can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague\\n  that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as\\n  employer/employee scenarios).  One can use it to pass information\\n  and evade any threat of direct retribution.  For example,\\n  `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,\\n  or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or\\n  retaliation. Sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information\\n  is often posted to some USENET groups, a risky situation where\\n  anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely\\n  independent of the identities of the participants.  Some police\\n  departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of\\n  crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.\\n  Unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with\\n  assurances of anonymity.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.3> How can anonymity be protected on the internet?\\n\\n  The chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in\\n  email and posting. However, anonymous accounts (public accounts as\\n  accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be\\n  effective as well, but this use is generally not officially\\n  supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and NSF\\n  guidelines.  The nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining\\n  accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous\\n  accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.\\n\\n  Many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to\\n  anonymity.  Virtually every protocol in existence currently\\n  contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.\\n  New communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee\\n  much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.4> What is `anonymous mail'?\\n\\n  One approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous\\n  server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by\\n  allocating and supplying an `anonymous ID' that is unique to the\\n  person requesting it (based on his email address).  This will vary\\n  for the same person for different machine address email\\n  originations. To send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed\\n  to the server containing the final destination. The server\\n  `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information\\n  and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the\\n  anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. \\n  This is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity\\n  mentioned above.\\n\\n  Another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer\\n  from a regular user account (no root system privileges are\\n  required). These are currently being pioneered by  Eric Hughes and\\n  Hal Finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. The operator runs a process on\\n  a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain\\n  characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail\\n  (typically fields in the header). One has been implemented as a \\n  PERL script running on UNIX.  Several of these are in existence\\n  currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;\\n  they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.\\n  The remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. \\n  Mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. \\n  Generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any\\n  responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,\\n  although actually may be held liable regardless.\\n\\n  These approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:\\n  \\n  - The anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of\\n    anonymous ID's to real addresses that must be maintained\\n    indefinitely.  One alternative is to allow `deallocation' of\\n    aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been\\n    implemented yet.\\n\\n  - Although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could\\n    conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the\\n    use of cryptography for basic protection,.\\n\\n  - Local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or\\n    under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.\\n  \\n  - Unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic\\n    that goes through them.\\n\\n  - Most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. \\n\\n  - The cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these\\n    operators are basically  network users who do not own the\\n    equipment and are accountable  to their own system\\n    administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic\\n    to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,\\n    regarding it as illicit use. \\n\\n  - In all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous\\n    server operator by the user.\\n\\n  Currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using SMTP\\n  protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary\\n  field information.  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the\\n  approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by\\n  most system administrators.  Information in the header routing data\\n  and logs of network port connection information may be retained\\n  that can be used to track the originating site.  In practice, this\\n  is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  Some\\n  administrators on the network will contact local administrators to\\n  request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished\\n  more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually\\n  happening occasionally but infrequently.\\n\\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \\n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.5> What is `anonymous posting'?\\n\\n  Anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous Usenet\\n  posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,\\n  capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  Make sure to\\n  test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to\\n  misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many\\n  sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the\\n  anonymous server to allocate anonymous IDs for those machines). \\n  See the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''\\n  before proceeding.\\n\\n  Another direct route involves using NNTP protocols to submit a\\n  message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.\\n  This practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed\\n  with hostility by most system administrators, and similar\\n  consequences can ensue.\\n\\n  See the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and \\n  ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.\\n\\n_____\\n<3.6> Why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?\\n\\n  As noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available\\n  to the general internet community, and these services should be\\n  used with great caution.  To summarize, the technology is in its\\n  infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not\\n  completely trustworthy.  No standards have been established and\\n  troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software\\n  are prevalent.  Here are some encountered and potential bugs: \\n  \\n  - One  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous\\n    return addresses. \\n  - Others passed signature information embedded in messages\\n    unaltered. \\n  - Address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced\\n    to a remailer are common.\\n  - Forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly\\n    allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon ID - email\\n    address  mappings in the alias file.  This can be remedied with\\n    the use of passwords.\\n  - Infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.\\n  \\n  Source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these\\n  systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  The\\n  field is not likely to improve considerably without  official\\n  endorsement and action by network agencies.  The whole idea is\\n  essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and\\n  distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable\\n  to criminality.  The major objection to anonymity over regular\\n  internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system\\n  operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting\\n  from outside complaints.  System adminstrators at some sites have\\n  threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the\\n  prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  This may only\\n  have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less\\n  characteristically detectable headers.  Probably the least\\n  problematic approach, and the most traditional to Usenet, is for\\n  individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,\\n  e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.\\n  \\n_____\\n<3.7> What is the future of anonymity on the internet?\\n\\n  New anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase\\n  safeguards of anonymity.  For example, the same mechanism that\\n  routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,\\n  can also be used to guarantee it. In a scheme called `chaining' an\\n  anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers\\n  before reaching a destination.  In this way generally multiple\\n  links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be\\n  compromised. Re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even\\n  more unlikely.  Even more significantly the anonymous remailers\\n  could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses\\n  (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)\\n  would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message\\n  tracing. However, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.\\n  \\n  The future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,\\n  highly uncertain and fraught with peril. While specific groups seem\\n  to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many\\n  feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a\\n  disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in\\n  `serious' groups.   The introduction of unlimited group anonymity\\n  may have fundamental repercussions on Usenet conventions and\\n  distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had\\n  in the past. For example, as part of new group creation, the\\n  charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. \\n\\n  Nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may\\n  be inevitable. Based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are\\n  in huge demand. Pervasive and readily available anonymity could\\n  carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  However, if\\n  its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may\\n  be confined to the underground.  The ramifications of widespread\\n  introduction of anonymity to Usenet are still largely unknown. It\\n  is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new\\n  traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater\\n  portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  Conceivably the\\n  services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social\\n  acceptance of Usenet.\\n\\n\\n* * *\",\n",

       "  'Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\\n\\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \\ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\\nthe book they\\'re talking about -- they compare the two things section\\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \\nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \\nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \\nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\\nlaw; and sure enough, that\\'s what the whole thing has mutated into, \\nurban-folklore style.\\n\\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \\ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \\nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don\\'t \\nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \\nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \\nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\\n\\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\\nlaw registry].\"\\n\\nBingo.  Exactly.  \\n\\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author\\'s admission.  He\\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \\nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \\nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there\\'s absolutely no reason to \\nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \\nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \\nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \\nherrings.\\n\\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \\nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \\nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \\nto have things translated when they *don\\'t know what they mean*.  If Dodd \\ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \\nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \\nwouldn\\'t he?\\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn\\'t they have any idea how to do it\\non their own?\\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \\nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd\\'s motivation isn\\'t a \\nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\\n\\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \\nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \\n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \\nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \\nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \\ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \\n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA\\'68...\" -- so \\nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.',\n",

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----',\n",

Xt Glossary\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\\n\\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\\n  widgets or gadgets.\\n\\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\\n  the Xt Intrinsics.

Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\\n\\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly\\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\\non the visual being used.  \\n\\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\\nlittle harder because you\\'ll need to initialize much of the toolkit\\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\\n\\n/*\\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\\n * than the default visual.\\n *\\n * To compile:\\n *\\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\\n *\\n * To run:\\n *\\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\\n *\\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\\n * to install.\\n */\\n\\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\\n\\ntypedef struct\\n{\\n\\tVisual\\t*visual;\\n\\tint\\tdepth;\\n} OptionsRec;\\n\\nOptionsRec\\tOptions;\\n\\nXtResource resources[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n\\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n};\\n\\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\\n\\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\\n};\\n\\n\\n\\nint\\nmain (argc, argv)\\n\\tint\\t\\targc;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**argv;\\n{\\n\\tXtAppContext\\tapp;\\t\\t/* the application context */\\n\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\t\\t/* toplevel widget */\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\t\\t/* display */\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**xargv;\\t/* saved argument vector */\\n\\tint\\t\\txargc;\\t\\t/* saved argument count */\\n\\tColormap\\tcolormap;\\t/* created colormap */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\tvinfo;\\t\\t/* template for find visual */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\t*vinfo_list;\\t/* returned list of visuals */\\n\\tint\\t\\tcount;\\t\\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\\n\\tArg\\t\\targs[10];\\n\\tCardinal\\tcnt;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*name = \"test\";\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*class = \"Test\";\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * save the command line arguments\\n\\t */\\n\\n\\txargc = argc;\\n\\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\\n\\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\\n\\t */\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\\n\\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   XtNumber (resources),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   args, cnt);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\\n\\t\\t/*\\n\\t\\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\\nsuch).\\n\\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\\nor just monochrome.\\n\\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\\'s offer all the above \\nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\\nshell.\\n\\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\\n\\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\\nvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n8.  I\\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n9.  Why doesn\\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\\n\\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\\nlist is traversed and each widget\\'s memory is actually free()\\'d, among\\nother things.\\n\\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\\n\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t}\\n\\nOne can see that the above code exit\\'s immediately after destroying\\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\\noccur.  \\n\\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\\n\\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\\ndifficult to maintain practices.\\n\\nTry the following code instead.\\n\\n\\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n\\n\\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern void ExitCallback (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tBoolean\\n\\tExitWorkProc (closure)\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t\\t/*NOTREACHED*/\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\\n\\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12. Why can\\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\\nnot fit most peoples\\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\\nOS\\'s it is the poll() system call.\\n\\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\\n\\nIt\\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\\nreliable.  In particular:\\n\\n\\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\\n\\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\\n\\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\\n\\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\\n\\n\\t- Pyramid, doesn\\'t work at all.\\n\\n\\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\\n\\t  sockets), wasn\\'t completely broken, but although the writing\\n\\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\\n\\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\\n\\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\\n\\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\\n\\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\\n\\t  been given the whole block).\\n\\n\\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\\'t also deal with signals at this\\npoint I don\\'t know.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13.

It looks good and works well but personally I think\\n\\t  it is poorly implemented.\\nOLIT\\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\\n\\t  implementing Sun\\'s Open Look specification.  Developed by\\n\\t  AT&T.  I\\'ve never used it so can\\'t comment on its quality.\\n\\t  I\\'ve heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\\n\\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\\n\\nXtra\\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\\n\\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\\n\\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\\n\\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I\\'ve never seen\\n\\t  them so I can\\'t comment.\\nFWF\\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\\n\\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\\n\\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\\n\\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\\n\\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\\nXcu\\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\\n\\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\\n\\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\\n\\t  widely used.\\nXs\\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\\n\\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\\nXw\\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\\n\\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\\n\\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\\n\\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\\n\\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\\n\\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\\nXo\\t- A widget set I\\'m working on.

How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\\n\\ttypdef struct\\n\\t{\\t\\n\\t    String\\tname;\\n\\t    long\\tvalue;\\n\\t} Arg;\\n\\nand the code:\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\\n\\nexpands to\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\targ.name = \"name\";\\n\\targ.value = 3.2;\\n\\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\\nhow to get around this?\\n\\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\\n\\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\\\n    } else { \\\\\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\\\n    }\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n17.

Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\\n\\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\\n\\n    string to data type\\n    data type to string\\n    data type to data type\\n\\ni) string to data type\\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\\n\\n\\tName\\t\\tValue\\n\\t\"True\"\\t\\t1\\n\\t\"False\"\\t\\t0\\n\\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\\n\\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\\n    of the converters.\\n\\nii) data type to string\\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\\'t necessary.  Instead,\\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\\n\\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\\n\\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\\n    converter, it isn\\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\\n    that they are consistent.\\n\\niii) data type to data type\\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\\n    red, green and blue.\\n\\n\\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\\n\\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\\n    Display *dpy;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\\n\\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\\nconverted value:\\n\\ntypedef struct {\\n    unsigned int    size;\\n    caddr_t         addr;\\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\\n\\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\\nreturn True.\\n\\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\\n\\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\\\n\\t    { \\\\\\n\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n\\t      return False; \\\\\\n\\t    } \\\\\\n\\t  else \\\\\\n\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n\\t  return False; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\\nconverter is being called properly.\\n\\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\\n\\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\\nXtSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\\nused.\\n\\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\\n\\n    XtCacheNone\\t\\tDon\\'t cache any converted values\\n    XtCacheAll\\t\\tCache all converted values\\n    XtCacheByDisplay\\tCache converted values on a per display basis\\n\\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\\n\\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\\n\\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    XrmValuePtr to;\\n    XtPointer converter_data;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n\\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\\n\\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\\nR5 distribution:\\n\\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\\nand remove it from the application context.\\n\\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\\nhappen 3 ways:\\n\\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\\n\\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\\n\\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\\n\\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\\n\\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\\ndemonstrates this:\\n\\n#include <setjmp.h>\\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\\n\\nvoid\\nXIOHandler (dpy)\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\n{\\n\\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\\n\\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\\n}\\n\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\\n\\t\\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\\n}\\n\\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\\'s enough information in the\\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\\npurpose it is adequate.\\n\\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\\nconnect to a display.\\n\\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\\n\\n\\t1. Args passed at creation time.\\n\\t2. Command line arguments.\\n\\t3. User\\'s per host defaults file\\n\\t4. User\\'s defaults file.\\n\\t5. User\\'s per application default file.\\n\\t6. System wide per application default file.\\n\\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\\n\\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\\n\\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nbut most do not.\\n\\nA user may have many per application default files containing\\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\\nis found.\\n\\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\\n\\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open\\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n\\t%N\\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\\n\\t\\tapplication\\'s class name.\\n\\t%T\\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n\\t\\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\\n\\t%C\\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\\n\\t%S\\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n\\t%L\\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n\\t%l\\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n\\t%t\\tThe territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\t%c\\tThe codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\nLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is\\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so\\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\\n\\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\\n\\nWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\\nbatch of default settings.)\\n\\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory\\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\\n\\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\\nguarantee the order of execution.\\n\\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\\nlist.\\n\\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\\n\\n \\t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\\n \\tprocedure is to be appended.\"\\n \\nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\\nlist.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\\n\\n\\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\\n\\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\\n\\n\\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\\nsuggestions.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\\nhandled something like:\\n\\n\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\\n\\t\\texit (1)\\n\\t}\\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\\n\\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\\n\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\\n\\telse\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\\n\\t++count;\\n\\nto be written as:\\n\\n\\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\\n\\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\\'ve\\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\\'m\\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\\n\\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\\nstructure or copying a string:\\n\\n\\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\\n\\t  char\\t     *ptr;\\n\\t  char\\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\\n\\n\\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\\t/* takes care of type casting */\\n\\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\\n\\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\\n\\n\\t char\\t      *ptr;\\n\\n\\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\\n\\t /* ... */\\n\\t free (ptr);\\n\\nmay not work.  Personally, I\\'d call any implementation that did this\\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\\n\\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFirst, I\\'d recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\\'s.  It\\'s a bit pricey\\nat $2750 but I\\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\\n\\n\\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\\n\\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\\n\\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\\n\\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\\n\\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\\n\\tmalloc\\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\\n\\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\\n\\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\\n\\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\\n\\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\\n\\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\\'s nearly\\n\\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\\n\\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\\n\\nAn alternative package that isn\\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\\nmany Unix\\'s and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\\nfor more info)\\n\\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\\'ll need to run in\\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\\'t run in synchronous\\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\\nserver are asynchronous.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    example% xload -xrm \\'*XtDebug:true\\' &\\n    example% xwininfo -tree\\n\\t     <click in new xload window>\\n\\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\\nof errant widgets.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\\ntest the way a widget manages it\\'s children, you can try\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\\nof both.  It\\'s a very clever idea.\\n\\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\\'ll need to\\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\\nUnfortunately you can\\'t give them because all the input is going to\\nyour application which is stopped.\\n\\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\\nusing a command sequence like this:\\n\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\t# Your favorite debugger.\\n\\tor this:\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\n\\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\\n\\t(gdb) run ...\\n\\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\\n\\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\\ndeal.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n26. Why don\\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \\n\\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\\nyou won\\'t get those events.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\\n\\n\\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\\n\\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\\n\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\\n\\nwould never invoke the timeout.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\\n\\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\\n``intuitive\\'\\' fashion.\\n\\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\\n\\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\\nprotocol for doing drag \\'n drop operations between clients.  My\\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\\nas it is based on Xt).\\n\\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\\nconventions, for more details read the code.\\n\\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.

       "  '[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]\\n\\n                       April 16, 1993\\n\\n      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  \\n                           PROPOSAL\\n\\n       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \\non cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \\nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \\neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \\nposed by new technology.\\n\\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \\nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \\nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \\nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \\n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \\nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \\nagents would store users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over \\nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \\nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \\navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \\ncommunications products.\\n\\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \\nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \\nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \\nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \\ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \\nbased on open standards.\\n\\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \\nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \\nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \\nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \\nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \\nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \\nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \\npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \\nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \\nindividual\\'s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \\ninquiries?  \\n\\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \\nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \\ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \\nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \\nthe discussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \\nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \\nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \\nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \\nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \\nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \\nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \\norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \\nyet.\\n\\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \\ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \\nusing it.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \\nwhich the government or others could break the code without \\nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \\nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \\nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \\nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \\narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \\nof the investigation would then be made public.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \\nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \\ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \\nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\\nDaniel J.

If you\\'re\\n  paying attention, I\\'ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\\n  \\nLater in the same post:\\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\\n\\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\\n\\nPreviously Awesley had written:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nPrompting me to write:\\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nTo which Awesley replied:\\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\\'re losing it so you\\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\\n  need some help, let me know and I\\'l take your side of this for a\\n  while.  You\\'re not scoring here, you\\'re boring here.\\n\\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\\nthat too is ludicrous.\\n\\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\n  it. \\n\\nAwesley relied:\\n     Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also\\n  heard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d\\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\\n\\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \\nArmy tanks don\\'t fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960\\'s\\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \\nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \\nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\\ndo not.\\n\\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\n\\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \\n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \\n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\\n\\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\\nhelped cover it up\"?\\n\\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\\nprefer\\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe\\n  that they did fire their guns.\\n\\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \\nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn\\'t it known?\\n\\nAwesley concludes:\\n     Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\\n  this far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the\\n  account I cited.\\n\\nActually, now we have established that I don\\'t believe what you believe, as\\nwell as why I don\\'t believe it.

       "  '\\n\\n\\n# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don\\'t agree\\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\\n\\n\\n\\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\\n# Holy Qur\\'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\\n\\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\\n     the same way?\\n\\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\\n# FLATLAND (if you haven\\'t already) or THE DRAGON\\'S EGG.  The first\\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\\n# cept...\\n\\n[some deleted for space saving]\\n\\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\\n\\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it\\'s okay to say\\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\\n     not some metaphor for something else.\\n\\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \\n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\\n\\n     Further, belief in God isn\\'t a bar to evil.  Let\\'s\\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \\n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\\n\\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\\n\\n\\nStephen\\n\\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\\n\\n',\n",

Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.

Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.

To find out more about\\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\\n\\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\\n  on performance.\\n\\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\\n\\nFonts\\n- - -\\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\\n  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.\\n\\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\\n\\t\\t\\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\\n\\t\\t\\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\\n\\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\\n  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since\\n  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.\\n\\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\\n\\nAbout the Resources File\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\\n    --ed.]\\n\\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \\n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\\n\\t\\t\\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\\n\\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\\n\\n  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\\n  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\\n\\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\\n  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.

Think also\\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large\\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\\n\\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\\n\\n  I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\\n\\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try\\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in\\n  more than one toolkit library.\\n\\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\\n\\n\\t\\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\\n\\nA Better Clock for X\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n1) xcuckoo\\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\\n\\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\\n   Saves screen real estate.\\n\\n2) mclock\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\\n\\n   Non Xt-based.

I\\'ve heard that\\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I\\'ve not found any\\n   yet.\\n\\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don\\'t have any hard\\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\\n   segments mean that xterm\\'s paging requirements are not that major.\\n\\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\\n   brought into memory.\\n\\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\\n   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.\\n   If you can provide some hard data, I\\'d like to see it.\\n   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,\\n   relative speed of each\\n\\n2) mterm\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in\\n     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.\\n\\n   \"I also have my own terminal emulator.

Examining the what was\\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\\n  requests?\\n\\n-------------------------\\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\\n-------------------------\\n\\nPretty Pictures\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Don\\'t use large bitmaps (GIF\\'s, etc) as root window backgrounds.\\n\\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\\n\\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I\\'m\\n    conscious of performance issues, I can\\'t comprehend it when I see\\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\\n\\n    I\\'ll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\\n\\n  - If you\\'re anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\\n\\n\\t\\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \\n\\t\\t\\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\\n\\nA Quicker Mouse\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\\n\\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \\n\\n  e.g. (for twm) :\\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\\t\\t\\tf.title\\n\\t\"  Very Fast\"\\t\\t\\t\\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\\n\\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\\t\\t\\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\\n\\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\\t! \"xset m default &\"\\n\\t\"  Glacial\"\\t\\t\\t\\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\\n      }\\n\\nProgramming Thoughts\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    To speed up applications that you\\'re developing, there are tons of\\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\\n\\n    - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual\\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\\n\\n    - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.\\n\\n    - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\\n\\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\\n      difference.\\n\\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\\n      one.\\n\\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet. I did some\\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\\n\\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\\n\\n  Andre\\' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\\n\\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\\n\\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\\n    run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.\\n\\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\\n\\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\\n\\nSay What!?\\n- - - - - - \\n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\\n\\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\\n    same operation between client and server.\\n\\n  I\\'m not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\\n  the following confirmation...\\n\\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. This\\n    helps a lot on my poor little SS1+ with only 16 MB, it was\\n    essential when I only had 8 MB.\\n\\n  Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov) :\\n    [The X11 Server and the client are] competing for the same CPU as\\n    your server when you run it on the same machine.  Not really a\\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\\n\\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU\\'s are mostly idle, X\\'s\\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\\n    action.\\n\\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\\n    cpu\\'s halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\\n    even fewer context switches.\\n\\n----------------------------\\nOther Sources of Information\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  Volume 8 in O\\'Reilly\\'s X Window System Series, ``X Window System\\n  Administrator\\'s Guide\\'\\' is a book all X administrator\\'s should read.\\n\\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

       "  '\\n[...]\\n\\nWait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US \\nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \\nfrom the Cubans\\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \\nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \\nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \\nwe \"invaded\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \\ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \\nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \\nSpain.\\n\\nSo if you mean by the word \"invaded\" some sort of military action where\\nwe cross someone\\'s border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally\\n\"invaded\" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.\\n(If some nation \"invades\" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be\\ninvading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of\\nview, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nNo, it\\'s someone who believes in \"peace-at-all-costs\".  In other words,\\na person who would have supported giving Hitler not only Austria and\\nCzechoslakia, but Poland too if it could have averted the War.  And one\\nwho would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political \\ndissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.\\n\\n\"Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,\" you ask?  Well, it depends\\non what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over\\nfreedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you\\nthan life itself; if you\\'d rather die fighting for liberty than live\\nunder a tyrant\\'s heel, then yes, it\\'s \"bad\" to be a peace-nik.\\n\\nThe problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are\\nnot like them to be \"bad\" and \"unconscionable\".  I would not have any\\nargument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and\\nstayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with \\nthe national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to\\nlegitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and \\nmany times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank\\nhypocrisy!)  All to stop we \"warmongers\" who are willing to stand up \\nand defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do\\nso requires a strong national defense.\\n\\nTime to get off the soapbox now.  :)\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nRegards,',\n",

A version is on export.\\n\\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\\nadapted to do this.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\\n\\n\\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \\nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \\napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\n\\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open Windows, and you also \\nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \\nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \\napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \\nXtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\\n                application\\'s class name.\\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n        %t      The territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n        %c      The codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is \\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \\nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\n\\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \\nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \\nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set \\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \\ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n\\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \\nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \\nMyterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so you can run the application\\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\\n%S are useless.\\n\\n\\tWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization \\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\n\\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \\ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\n\\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n\\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\\nthis batch of default settings.)\\n\\n\\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n\\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory \\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \\nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\n\\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \\nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \\ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \\nby a slash.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\\n\\nThe answer lies in changing xdm\\'s xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \\nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \\n\\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \\nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \\n\\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\\n\\t#!/bin/sh\\n\\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\\n\\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \\nthe path.)\\n\\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\\n\\t\\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\\n\\t\\t\\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\\n\\t\\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\\n\\n\\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\\n\\n-- Is the font directory you\\'re specifying readable from the SERVER\\'s file\\n   system?  Remember, it\\'s the server, not the client, which interprets your\\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\\n\\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you\\'re running an MIT server\\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can\\'t find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you\\'re\\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can\\'t find\\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\\n\\n-- If you\\'re in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you\\'re using.\\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won\\'t work for\\n   Open Windows.

       "  'April 16, 1993\\n\\nINITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY PROPOSAL\\n\\nThe Clinton Administration today made a major announcement on\\ncryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of\\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a\\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as\\nexport controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to\\nrobust encryption, and law enforcement issues posed by new technology.\\n\\nHowever, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has already\\nreached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before any\\npublic comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the\\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone\\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the\\nNational Security Agency.  The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an 80-bit,\\nsplit key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips\\nmanufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow agents would\\nstore users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon\\npresentation of a valid warrant.  The encryption scheme used is to be\\nclassified, but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for\\nincorporation into its communications products.\\n\\n     This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\nFirst, the Administration has adopted a solution before conducting an\\ninquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper Chip may not be the most secure\\nproduct. Other vendors or developers may have better schemes.\\nFurthermore, we should not rely on the government as the sole source for\\nthe Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers\\nshould be able to produce chipsets based on open standards.\\n\\nSecond, an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested. Yet, the\\nAdministration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified.  EFF\\nbelieves that any standard adopted ought to be public and open.  The\\npublic will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is\\nopen to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\nThird, while the use of the use of a split-key, dual escrowed system may\\nprove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement\\nneeds, the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is\\nadopted.  What will give people confidence in the safety of their keys? \\nDoes disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual\\'s Fifth\\nAmendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries?  These are but a few\\nof the many questions the Administrations proposal raised but fails to\\nanswer.\\n\\nIn sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance\\nof these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy\\nand security.  However, the \"Clipper Chip\" solution ought to be\\nconsidered as part of the inquiry, and not be adopted before the\\ndiscussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of whom\\nhold 40-bits of each key.  The manufacturer of the communications device\\nwould be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow\\nagents.  A key is tied to the device, however, not the person using it.\\n\\nUpon presentation of a valid court order, the two escrow agents would\\nhave to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents.  According to\\nthe Presidential Directive just issued, the Attorney General will be\\nasked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the Administration\\nhave suggested that one non-law enforcement federal agency (perhaps the\\nFederal Reserve), and one non-governmental organization could be chosen,\\nbut there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back doors -- means by which\\nthe government or others could break the code without securing keys from\\nthe escrow agents -- and that the President will be told there are no\\nback doors to this classified algorithm.  In order to prove this,\\nAdministration sources are interested in arranging for an all-star crypto\\ncracker team to come in, under a security arrangement, and examine the\\nalgorithm for trap doors.  The results of the investigation would then be\\nmade public.\\n\\nThe Clipper Chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole-source,\\nsecret contract between the National Security Agency and two private\\nfirms:  VLSI and Mycotronx.  NSA work on this plan has been underway for\\nabout four years.  The manufacturing contract was let 14 months ago.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government believes\\nin the security of this system, the feds will be the first big customers\\nfor this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, VP Al\\nGore, and maybe even the President.  At today\\'s Commerce Department press\\nbriefing, a number of people asked this question, though:  why would any\\nprivate organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had\\nno independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors?\\n\\nCOMPREHENSIVE POLICY INQUIRY\\n\\nThe Administration has also announced that it is about to commence an\\ninquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection, encryption,\\nand law enforcement.  The items to be considered include:  export\\ncontrols on encryption technology and the FBI\\'s Digital Telephony\\nProposal.  It appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the\\nNational Security Council.  Unfortunately, however, the Presidential\\nDirective describing the inquiry is classified.  Some public involvement\\nin the process has been promised, but they terms have yet to be specified.\\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director (jberman@eff.org)\\nDaniel J.

       "  '\\n   Each chip includes the following components:\\n\\n      the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n      F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n      N, a 30-bit serial number\\n      U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\nHmmm. A thirty bit serial number. And, we are told, the unit key U is\\nderived deterministically from this serial number. That means that\\nthere are only one billion possible unit keys.\\n\\n   To generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\n   first padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\n   S1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n   64-bit block R1:\\n\\n\\t   R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   Similarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\n   N3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n\\t   R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n\\t   R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\n   R1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\n   first 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\n   rest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\n   are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\n   agencies.\\n\\nHmmm. We must assume that generating the unit key U from the serial\\nnumber N rather than generating it from a randomly selected U1 and U2\\nis an intentional way of assuring a \"fail safe\" for the government --\\nU is completedly determined given S1, S2 and N. If S1 and S2 do not\\nchange they constitute effective \"master keys\" (along with F), the\\ntheft of which (or the possession of which by various authorities)\\ncompletely obviates the security of the system. However, more\\ninterestingly, we know, for a fact that if S1 and S2 are fixed no\\nmatter what the keyspace for U is no more than 2^30. Why not pick U1\\nand U2 at random? Why this interesting restriction of they key space\\nif it NOT to provide an additional back door?\\n\\nI find it disturbing that at the very best my security is dependant on\\napproximately 30 bytes worth of information that could be written on\\nthe back of a napkin.\\n\\nEven if S1 and S2 change periodically, the rationale behind this\\nrestriction in the size of the keyspace seems strange if one is\\nassuming that the goal is security -- and makes perfect sense if the\\ngoal is an illusion of security.\\n\\nIf S1 and S2 do not change, even if they remain secret I wonder if\\nthey can somehow be back-derived given enough unit key/serial number\\npairs. We are assured that this cannot happen -- but no one\\nunderstands how Skipjack works outside of government officials and,\\nsoon, foreign intelligence services that gain the information via\\nespionage. Presumably we will eventually have the information as well\\n-- reverse engineering gets more and more advanced every year -- but\\nby the time we know it may be too late.\\n\\n   As a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\n   written onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\n   file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\n   U1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\n   disk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n   2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\n   After the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\n   vault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\n   assurance that no information is left behind.\\n\\nNone of this makes me feel the least bit secure. The silly notion of\\n\"destroying the laptop\" appears to be yet another bizarre distraction.\\nWe all know that you can\\'t read data from DRAM that has been turned\\noff for more than a few moments. On the other hand, what we don\\'t know\\nis why there is a need to generate the unit keys from S1 and S2 in the\\nfirst place other than to weaken the system. We don\\'t know if the\\nagents in question would resist a million in cash a piece for their\\ninformation -- its probably worth hundreds of million, so you can make\\nthe bribe arbitrarily hard to resist. And to tell you the truth, doing\\nthis in a \"vault\" rather than in Joe Random Tempest-shielded Room\\nwith a laptop computer seems like melodrama designed to make\\nhigh-school dropouts from Peoria impressed -- but it does very little\\nfor most of the rest of us.\\n\\n   The protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\n   room instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\n   and the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\n   the escrow agencies.\\n\\nWhat would this provide? Lets say the escrow agencies are the ACLU and\\nthe NRA and their agents personally take back the disks and are always\\nhonest. Who cares? The NSA must be laughing out loud, because they\\nhave the algorithm to regenerate U given N and likely don\\'t need to\\nsteal they keys as they effectively already have them.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com',\n",

According\\n-> > to the Federalist Paper\\'s, a well regulated militia has a well defined \\n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\\n-> \\n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\\n\\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\\n\\n\\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\\n\\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\\n\\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\\n\\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\\n\\t character of a well-regulated militia, \\n\\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \\n\\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\\n\\n    \\tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\\n\\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\\n\\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\\n\\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\\n\\ta year.\\n\\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \\nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \\n\\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \\na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \\n\\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\\n\\n\\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \\n\\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \\n\\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \\n\\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \\n\\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \\n\\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \\n\\tNational Guard.\\n\\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \\nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\\n\\n\\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \\n\\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \\n\\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \\n\\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \\n\\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \\n\\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\\n\\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \\n\\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\\n\\n\\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \\n\\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\n\\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\\n\\trecital of particulars.\"\\n\\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \\nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \\nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\\n\\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\\n\\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \\n\\t   this puzzle\"\\n\\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\\n\\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\\' justify:\\n\\t   explain an error\\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\\nfor \"qualify\" is:\\n\\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\\n\\t   of; characterize.\\n\\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \\n\\t   task.\\n\\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\\n\\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\\n\\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\\n\\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \\nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \\nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \\n\\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \\nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \\npeople\\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \\nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\\nme.\\n\\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\\n\\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \\nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \\nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \\nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.

       "  'Archive-name: ripem/attacks\\nLast-update: 31 Mar 93 21:00:00 -0500\\n\\nSOME POSSIBLE ATTACKS ON RIPEM\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a living list of potential weaknesses to keep your eyes open\\nfor when using RIPEM for secure electronic mail.  It does not go into\\ngreat detail, and is almost certainly not exhaustive.  Obviously, many\\nof the weaknesses are weaknesses of cryptographically secured mail in\\ngeneral, and will pertain to secure mail programs other than RIPEM.\\nIt is maintained by Marc VanHeyningen <mvanheyn@cs.indiana.edu>.  It\\nis posted monthly to a variety of news groups; followups pertaining\\nspecifically to RIPEM should go to alt.security.ripem.\\n\\nCRYPTANALYSIS ATTACKS\\n---------------------\\n\\n- Breaking RSA would allow an attacker to find out your private key,\\n  in which case he could read any mail encrypted to you and sign\\n  messages with your private key.\\n\\n  RSA is generally believed to be resistant to all standard\\n  cryptanalytic techniques.  Even a standard key (about 516 bits with\\n  RIPEM) is long enough to render this impractical, barring a\\n  huge investment in hardware or a breakthrough in factoring.\\n\\n- Breaking DES would allow an attacker to read any given message,\\n  since the message itself is encrypted with DES.  It would not allow\\n  an attacker to claim to be you.\\n\\n  DES has only 56 bits in its key, and thus could conceivably be\\n  compromised by brute force with sufficient hardware, but few agencies\\n  have such money to devote to simply read one message.  Since each\\n  message has a different DES key, the work for each message would\\n  remain high.\\n\\nKEY MANAGEMENT ATTACKS\\n----------------------\\n\\n- Stealing your private key would allow the same benefits as breaking\\n  RSA.  To safeguard it, it is encrypted with a DES key which is derived\\n  from a passphrase you type in.  However, if an attacker can get a copy\\n  of your private keyfile and your passphrase (by snooping network\\n  packets, tapping lines, or whatever) he could break the whole scheme.\\n\\n  The main risk is that of transferring either the passphrase or the\\n  private key file across an untrusted link.  So don\\'t do that.  Run \\n  RIPEM on a trusted machine, preferably one sitting right in front of\\n  you.  Ideally, your own machine in your own home (or maybe office)\\n  which nobody else has physical access to.\\n\\n- Fooling you into accepting a bogus public key for someone else could \\n  allow an opponent to deceive you into sending secret messages to him\\n  rather than to the real recipient.  If the enemy can fool your\\n  intended recipient as well, he could re-encrypt the messages with\\n  the other bogus public key and pass them along.\\n\\n  It is important to get the proper public keys of other people.\\n  The most common mechanism for this is finger; assuming the opponent\\n  has not compromised routers or daemons or such, finger can be \\n  given a fair amount of trust.  The strongest method of key\\n  authentication is to exchange keys in person; however, this is\\n  not always practical.  Having other people \"vouch for you\" by\\n  signing a statement containing your key is possible, although \\n  RIPEM doesn\\'t have features for doing this as automatically as\\n  PGP.  RIPEM does generate and check MD5 fingerprints of public keys\\n  in the key files; they may be exchanged via a separate channel for\\n  authentication.\\n\\nPLAYBACK ATTACKS\\n----------------\\n\\n- Even if an opponent cannot break the cryptography, an opponent could\\n  still cause difficulties.  For example, suppose you send a message\\n  with MIC-ONLY (a PEM mode which does not provide disclosure protection)\\n  to Alice which says \"OK, let\\'s do that.\" Your opponent intercepts\\n  it, and now resends it to Bob, who now has a message which is\\n  authenticated as from you telling him to do that.  Of course, he may\\n  interpret it in an entirely different context.  Or your opponent\\n  could transmit the same message to the same recipient much later,\\n  figuring it would be seen differently at a later time.  Or the\\n  opponent could change the Originator-Name: to himself, register \\n  your public key as his, and send a message hoping the recipient\\n  will send him return mail indicating (perhaps even quoting!) the\\n  unknown message.\\n\\n  To defeat playback attacks, the plaintext of each message should \\n  include some indication of the sender and recipient, and a unique\\n  identifier (typically the date).  A good front-end script for RIPEM\\n  should do this automatically (IMHO).  As a recipient, you should be\\n  sure that the Originator-Name: header and the sender indicated within\\n  the plaintext are the same, that you really are a recipient, and that\\n  the message is not an old one.  Some this also can and should be\\n  automated.  The author of this FAQ has made a modest attempt at\\n  automating the process of generating and checking encapsulated\\n  headers; the programs are included in the standard distribution in\\n  the utils directory.\\n\\nLOCAL ATTACKS\\n-------------\\n\\n- Clearly, the security of RIPEM cannot be greater than the security of\\n  the machine where the encryption is performed.  For example, under\\n  UNIX, a super-user could manage to get at your encrypted mail,\\n  although it would take some planning and effort to do something like\\n  replace the RIPEM executable with a Trojan horse or to get a copy of\\n  the plaintext, depending how it\\'s stored.\\n\\n  In addition, the link between you and the machine running RIPEM is\\n  an extension of that.  If you decrypt with RIPEM on a remote machine\\n  which you are connected to via network (or, worse yet, modem), an\\n  eavesdropper could see the plaintext (and probably also your\\n  passphrase.)\\n\\n  RIPEM should only be executed on systems you trust, obviously.  In\\n  the extreme case, RIPEM should only be used on your own machine,\\n  which you have total control over and which nobody else has access\\n  to, which has only carefully examined software known to be free of\\n  viruses, and so on.  However, there\\'s a very real trade-off between\\n  convenience and security here.\\n\\n  A more moderately cautious user might use RIPEM on a UNIX workstation\\n  where other people have access (even root access), but increase\\n  security by keeping private keys and the (statically linked, of\\n  course) executable on a floppy disk.\\n\\n  Some people will keep RIPEM on a multi-user system, but when dialing\\n  in over an insecure line, they will download the message to their\\n  own system and perform the RIPEM decryption there.  However, the\\n  security provided by such a mechanism is somewhat illusory; since\\n  you presumably type your cleartext password to log in, you\\'ve just\\n  given away the store, since the attacker can now log in as you and\\n  install traps in your account to steal your private key next time\\n  you use it from a less insecure line.  This will likely remain the\\n  situation as long as most systems use the rather quaint mechanism of\\n  cleartext password authentication.\\n\\n  I find it nice to put a brief statement of how carefully I manage my\\n  security arrangement in my .plan next to my public key, so that\\n  potential correspondents can be aware what level of precautions are\\n  in place.  Some people use two keys, a short one which is not\\n  carefully managed for ordinary use and a longer one which is treated\\n  with greater care for critical correspondence.\\n\\nUNTRUSTED PARTNER ATTACKS\\n-------------------------\\n\\n- RIPEM\\'s encryption will ensure that only a person with the private key\\n  corresponding to the public key used to encrypt the data may read the\\n  traffic.  However, once someone with that key gets the message, she\\n  may always make whatever kind of transformations she wishes.  There \\n  exist no cryptographic barriers to a recipient, say, taking an\\n  ENCRYPTED message and converting it to a MIC-ONLY message, signed by\\n  you and readable by anyone, although RIPEM does not provide this\\n  functionality.  Indeed, the latest PEM draft I have seen specifically\\n  states that such transformations should be possible to allow\\n  forwarding functions to work.',\n",

Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\",\n",

At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n\\n\\nCHIP CONTENTS\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\nThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\\n\"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\\nimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\\n$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\\ntechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n\\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\nvalues:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n\\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n\\nThe ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver\\'s device using the\\nsession key:\\n\\n   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\\n\\n\\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n\\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\\nInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\nMykotronx.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\\n80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\\n80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\\nkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\\nfunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\\n  \\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n64-bit block R1:\\n\\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\nagencies.\\n\\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\\nan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\\nknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\\nkey parts.  \\n\\nThe third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\\nprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\\nleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\\ninformation is left behind.\\n \\nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\nthe escrow agencies. \\n\\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\nboth may be independent from the government.\\n\\n\\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n\\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\\nClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\\nfamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\\nhas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\\nthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\\nreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\\ntogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\\nsession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\\nbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.\\n\\n\\nCAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\\n\\nA successor to the Clipper Chip, called \"Capstone\" by the government\\nand \"MYK-80\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\\nthe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\\nexponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\\ntesting on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for\\ndelivery in June or July.\\n',\n",

       "  'I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details\\non how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The\\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\\n\\n-------\\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\\nSubject: Clipper Chip\\n\\n\\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday\\'s NY Times,\\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\\nif I have anything wrong):\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \\nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \\nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \\nspecific. I don\\'t know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \\ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \\nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \\nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \\nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \\nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \\nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \\nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \\nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \\ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \\nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \\nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \\nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \\npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \\nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\\n\\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \\nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \\nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \\nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \\nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \\nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \\nproducing\\n\\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\\n\\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \\nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \\nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \\nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \\ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \\nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \\n\\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\\n\\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \\nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \\nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \\nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\\n\\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \\nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \\nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \\nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \\norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \\nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \\nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford\\'s attorney general (right\\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \\nNo single person or authority should have the power to\\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\\n\\nMartin Hellman\\n\\n----\\n\\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\\nTo: smb@research.att.com\\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\\n\\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \\nif you also post this message with it in which:\\n\\n1.

Here's some\\n  ciphertext: FHDSIJOYW^&%$*#@OGBUJHKFSYUIRE. Is it strong?'' Without a\\n  doubt questions like this are the most annoying traffic on sci.crypt.\\n\\n  If you have come up with an encryption scheme, providing some\\n  ciphertext from it is not adequate. Nobody has ever been impressed by\\n  random gibberish. Any new algorithm should be secure even if the\\n  opponent knows the full algorithm (including how any message key is\\n  distributed) and only the private key is kept secret. There are some\\n  systematic and unsystematic ways to take reasonably long ciphertexts\\n  and decrypt them even without prior knowledge of the algorithm, but\\n  this is a time-consuming and possibly fruitless exercise which most\\n  sci.crypt readers won't bother with.\\n\\n  So what do you do if you have a new encryption scheme? First of all,\\n  find out if it's really new. Look through this FAQ for references and\\n  related methods. Familiarize yourself with the literature and the\\n  introductory textbooks.\\n\\n  When you can appreciate how your cryptosystem fits into the world at\\n  large, try to break it yourself! You shouldn't waste the time of tens\\n  of thousands of readers asking a question which you could have easily\\n  answered on your own.\\n\\n  If you really think your system is secure, and you want to get some\\n  reassurance from experts, you might try posting full details of your\\n  system, including working code and a solid theoretical explanation, to\\n  sci.crypt. (Keep in mind that the export of cryptography is regulated\\n  in some areas.)\\n\\n  If you're lucky an expert might take some interest in what you posted.\\n  You can encourage this by offering cash rewards---for instance, noted\\n  cryptographer Ralph Merkle is offering $1000 to anyone who can break\\n  Snefru-4---but there are no guarantees. If you don't have enough\\n  experience, then most likely any experts who look at your system will\\n  be able to find a flaw. If this happens, it's your responsibility to\\n  consider the flaw and learn from it, rather than just add one more\\n  layer of complication and come back for another round.\\n\\n  A different way to get your cryptosystem reviewed is to have the NSA\\n  look at it. A full discussion of this procedure is outside the scope\\n  of this FAQ.\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\nSo, like, what do you do during those six months to be \"active?\"\\nMy town has a similar requirement, and it\\'s rather stupid.  Before\\nyou can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.\\nWell, how active can you be without a gun, chief?\\n\\nMost gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental\\ndisorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn\\'t be abused by the\\ngovernment.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some\\ntrapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you\\nare perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.\\n\\n\\nSince the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US \\nis around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun\\nowners, I\\'d think twice before using this analogy.\\n\\nBesides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There\\nare about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but\\nonly 1,400 accidents.)  I don\\'t think it\\'s necessary to spend a lot\\nof energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.\\n\\nJust like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring\\nsafety courses -- IF they couldn\\'t be abused by the government.  But \\nthey already have!  One state doesn\\'t hold the courses, another doesn\\'t \\nfund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence \\nto those with political connections.  Is this fair?\\n\\n\\nAnd how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?\\nHow many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?\\n\\n\\nSome states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.\\nSome allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed \\ncarry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage\\nover another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,\\nthen state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.\\nWhich means that they really don\\'t have any objective reasons for \\nthese laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.\\n\\n\\n(\"Hot-livered.\"  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say \"hot-headed.\")\\n\\n\\nTypically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other\\npeople are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals\\naffect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this\\nduring the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts\\nNO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that\\nthe crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to\\npossess a gun, but we don\\'t feel it is right to treat common citizens\\nwho have lived good lives as if they were just \"pre-felons\" waiting to\\ncommit crimes.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t understand this sentence.\\n\\n\\nLife isn\\'t fair.  I shouldn\\'t need a fire extinguisher either, or\\nflood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.\\nBut pining for a better world won\\'t do anything to address what I have\\nto do to live in this one.\\n\\n\\nNone of ours, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n\\nFrankly, I\\'m not sure I know what good a driver\\'s license does anyone,\\neither.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who \\ndrive drunk, drive without it!\\n\\nHowever, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.\\nI rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.\\n\\n\\nThe question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It\\'s\\nwhether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.\\nI don\\'t have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.\\nI do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning\\none, too.\\n-- ',\n",

There\\nare many, many bad things going on in that area.  Also, I have several friends\\nthat live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these\\nfolks.  By the way, where did I say that they were minorities?  Do you think\\nthat only minorities have gangs?  Not so.

All I do know is that I was there, I live\\nhere and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough it\\nbecomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  One last\\nthing.  My sister is a social worker.

The paradox is that you can\\'t really have the former, \\nin the long term, unless you have the latter.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that I probably come across to some people as a weird \\ncross between a libertarian and an \"establishment tool\" is that I end up \\ntaking an utterly pragmatic view of government.  I don\\'t get up in arms when \\nthe government fails to protect the interests of the people, because in my \\nlifetime it never has--therefore, I have no expectation that it will.  \\n\\nAs a result, I protect my own interests rather than expecting the government \\nto be \"fair\".  I will use strong cryptography when I think it is needed, \\nwhether or not it is legal at the time.  Same thing with anything else the \\ngovernment would rather not see in private hands--that\\'s their problem.  \\nWhat\\'s important to me is using the right tool for the job.  If it\\'s legal, \\nso much the better.  If it is not, but does not violate my (very strong) \\nsense of personal ethics, I will use it anyway as long I think it is worth \\nit.  Expecting the government to actually protect the interests of its \\ncitizens, except by accident, is utter folly.  Even Jefferson, one of the \\nmajor architects of the American system of government, figured that in a \\ncouple hundred years it would become so corrupt and self-serving that it \\nwould be time dismantle it and try again, by revolution if necessary.  I \\nagree, and while I don\\'t go around trying to spark one, I\\'ll certainly \\nparticipate if it happens when I\\'m around.  There is a reason I am such a \\nstrong supporter of individual rights while being so cynical about politics.  \\nI\\'ve already written off politics.\\n\\nAnd yes, this may get me in trouble some day.  If so, so be it.  I drive \\nfaster than 55 MPH, too.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \\nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \\nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\\n\\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\\nEither the smart bombs didn\\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\\ndestroying Iraq\\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are\\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\\ntyrant-dictator. \\n\\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\\nI don\\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\\nwith smart bombs, it\\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n\\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\\n\\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \\nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\\'d be speaking\\nGerman instead of English right now.\\n\\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \\n\\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\\na reasonable doubt of one\\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position\\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\\n       \\nRegards,',\n",

Government has developed a microcircuit that not only\\n   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust\\n   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of\\n   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the\\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\\nfor the other 40-bit key.\\n\\nSimilarly, it didn\\'t say \"We\\'re making encryption is commercially available.\"\\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\\n\\nThe next thing it didn\\'t say is \"We\\'re making encryption legal\",\\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\\nPresident can\\'t change the First Amendment merely by decree.\\nWhat it *did* say was:\\n\\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\\n\\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\\n\\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\\n\\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\\nwhich clearly means \"We\\'re making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\\nSoon.  Once business buys into this.\"\\n\\nAnother thing it didn\\'t say is \"We\\'re going to ask Congress for money\\nto do *lots* more wiretapping\", because of course, there\\'s a budget crisis,\\nand Congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash.\\nWhat it *did* say was:\\n   The Attorney General will procure and utilize encryption devices to\\n   the extent needed to preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct\\n   lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure\\n   law enforcement communications.  Further, the Attorney General\\n   shall utilize funds from the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture\\n   Super Surplus Fund to effect this purchase.\\nwhich means \"We\\'ve got money Congress can\\'t control and we\\'re going to\\nbuy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect NON-APPROVED CRYPTO\\n(that\\'s what \"preserve the government\\'s ability to conduct ... surveillance\" \\nmeans.)

It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\\npolice agencies to \"go rogue\" and try to get keys through more efficient\\n\\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n        decipher the message?\\n\\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^\\n        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe clear implication is that there are \"legal\" authorizations other\\nthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \\nknows what\\'s in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\\nmay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\\nkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\\nposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\\nalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\\nare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens\\' rights to access\\npolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\\nvery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\\nevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\\n\\nThrow in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\\nrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who\\'ve \"retired\" from intelligence\\nagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\\n\\nDon\\'t think it\\'ll happen?  \\n\\nWell, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\\norganization, which for years kept \"Red Files\" on thousands of suspected \\ncommies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\\nof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\\nhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People\\'s Friendship\\nrally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\\nplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \\nmeeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\\n(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\\nmore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\\nas well.)\\n\\nEven with well-meaning cops (and I\\'m sure there are many), there will \\nbe strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don\\'t need\\nto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \\nof enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \\nCompromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \\nwill be a moral dilemma.\\n\\nClipper will make criminals out of cops.

Since we, as American\\'s, have the \\ngurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the\\n2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public\\'s opinion or risk \\nvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with\\ndomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.\\n  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.

Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"',\n",

It supports all 4 DES modes of\\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n\\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\nvalues:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n\\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n\\n------------------\\n\\nsuppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the N for my chip, but\\ndid not know F, then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine F from\\nif law enforcement field \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F]\\nnot knowing N would might make this much harder.\\n\\nNow suppose that I know F, (either legitimately or not),\\nIf I know K (either because I am involved in the conversation, or I know U\\nfor a party in the conversation), I may now be able to determine U for the\\nother party.\\n\\nIf I know F I can also defeat the law enforcement field, since I could\\nmake my own, with a different K then the one I am using. Knowing F also\\nallows traffic analysis to be performed. So I might not know what you are\\nsaying but I could know who you are saying it too.\\n\\nNow I admit that someone trying to compute U will not have lots of\\nmessages to work from, but since we have no way of knowing that the key\\ngeneration method does not (deliberately?) generate weak keys, or for that\\nmatter that the published method is in fact used, perhaps the U\\'s will be\\nchosen from know weak keys for the system.\\n\\nObviously the compromise of F would be a disaster, both to law enforcement\\nfor whom this whole thing is designed, and for the people who believe that\\nit is giving them security. F is but one number, and I sure that alot of\\npeople (more then 1) know what it is (and if some \"panel of experts\" is\\ngoing to check it over for flaws then many more will know F, forget\\ngrinding chips, bribery and blackmail work just fine.\\n\\nSo, am I wrong?

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.

At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n\\n\\nCHIP STRUCTURE\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified 64-bit block encryption\\nalgorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys (compared\\nwith 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling (compared with 16\\nfor the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of operation.  Throughput is\\n16 Mbits a second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate a session key K with\\nthe device at the other end (in general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used).  The key K and message stream M (i.e., digitized voice) are then\\nfed into the Clipper Chip to produce two values:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement block.  \\n\\nThe law enforcement block thus contains the session key K encrypted\\nunder the unit key U concatenated with the serial number N, all\\nencrypted under the family key F.\\n\\n\\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n\\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (secure computer\\ninformation facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\nMikotronx.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters an 80-bit value S1\\ninto the laptop and agent 2 enters an 80-bit value S2. These values\\nserve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers.\\n\\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n64-bit block R1:\\n\\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\nagencies.\\n\\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n2 takes the second disk.  The third disk is used to program the chips.\\nAfter the chips are programmed, all information is discarded from the\\nvault and the agents leave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional\\nassurance that no information is left behind.\\n \\nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\nthe escrow agencies.\\n\\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\nboth may be independent from the government.\\n\\n\\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n\\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with\\nClipper.  They will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the\\nfamily key F.  This gives them E[K; U] + N.  They will then take a\\nwarrant identifying the chip serial number N to each of the key escrow\\nagents and get back U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed together to produce\\nthe unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the session key K.\\nFinally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will be accomplished\\nthrough a special black box decoder operated by the FBI.\\n',\n",

Given the hash it is computationally\\n  impossible to find a message with that hash; in fact one can't\\n  determine any usable information about a message with that hash, not\\n  even a single bit. For some one-way hash functions it's also\\n  computationally impossible to determine two messages which produce the\\n  same hash.\\n\\n  A one-way hash function can be private or public, just like an\\n  encryption function. Here's one application of a public one-way hash\\n  function, like MD5 or Snefru. Most public-key signature systems are\\n  relatively slow. To sign a long message may take longer than the user\\n  is willing to wait. Solution: Compute the one-way hash of the message,\\n  and sign the hash, which is short. Now anyone who wants to verify the\\n  signature can do the same thing.\\n\\n  Another name for one-way hash function is message digest function.\\n\\n* What is the difference between public, private, secret, shared, etc.?\\n\\n  There is a horrendous mishmash of terminology in the literature for a\\n  very small set of concepts. When an algorithm depends on a key which\\n  isn't published, we call it a private algorithm; otherwise we call it\\n  a public algorithm. We have encryption functions E and decryption\\n  functions D, so that D(E(M)) = M for any message M. We also have\\n  hashing functions H and verification functions V, such that V(M,X) = 1\\n  if and only if X = H(M).\\n\\n  A public-key cryptosystem has public encryption and private\\n  decryption. Checksums, such as the application mentioned in the\\n  previous question, have public hashing and public verification.\\n  Digital signature functions have private hashing and public\\n  verification: only one person can produce the hash for a message,\\n  but everyone can verify that the hash is correct.\\n\\n  Obviously, when an algorithm depends on a private key, it's meant to\\n  be unusable by anyone who doesn't have the key. There's no real\\n  difference between a ``shared'' key and a private key: a shared key\\n  isn't published, so it's private. If you encrypt data for a friend\\n  rather than ``for your eyes only'', are you suddenly doing\\n  ``shared-key encryption'' rather than private-key encryption? No.\\n\\n* What are MD4 and MD5?\\n\\n  MD4 and MD5 are message digest functions developed by Ron Rivest.\\n  Definitions appear in RFC 1320 and RFC 1321 (see part 10). Code is\\n  available from [FTPMD].\\n\\n  Note that a transcription error was found in the original MD5 draft\\n  RFC. The corrected algorithm should be called MD5a, though some\\n  people refer to it as MD5.\\n\\n* What is Snefru?\",\n",

Our original implementation of the toolkit\\nuses Xsi.\\n\\nOur toolkit manages each character\\'s size based on our own font management system.\\nIn order to do that, the \\'wchar_t\\' typed character strings must be decomposed\\nto character sets. This means that if one wchar_t type compound string with \\nASCII and Kanji mixed, for example, is given, each element of the wchar_t\\narray must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout\\nand application environment\\'s locale. In this case if the locale is \\'japanese\\',\\neach wchar_t character will be classified either to iso8859-1, jisx0208 or so.\\n\\nWe need a function to do this.

Floppy disks may be \\ncleared by applying a vendor\\'s formatting program that overwrites \\neach location with a given character.\\n\\nFixed media (e.g., Winchester disks) should be cleared by overwriting \\nat least one time with any one character.  One way to do this is by \\napplying a vendor-supplied formatting program that overwrites each \\nlocation on the disk with a given character, if it can be shown that \\nthis program actually works as advertised.  The user should beware: \\nsome programs that purport to overwrite all locations do not \\nactually do this.\\n\\nCleared media may be resides within the controlled facility or \\nreleased for destruction; however, they should be marked and \\ncontrolled at the level of the most restrictive sensitivity of \\ninformation ever recorded.\\n\\n7.6.2.2 Declassification of Magnetic Media\\n\\nCertain types of removable media can be declassified using a \\ndegaussing device that has been approved for declassifying media of \\nthat type.  (A list of approved devices is maintained by the NSA.)\\n\\nIf a fixed medium (for example, a hard, or Winchester, disk) is \\noperative, an approved method of declassifying the disk pack is to \\nemploy an overwrite procedure which must overwrite all \\naddressable locations at least three times by writing any character, \\nthen its complement (e.g., binary ones and binary zeros) \\nalternatively.\\n\\nWhen fixed  media become inoperative, it is impossible to declassify \\nthe media by the overwrite method.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate.

Where can I get patches to X11R5?\\n\\n\\tThe release of new public patches by the MIT X Consortium is announced\\nin the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.\\n\\n\\tPatches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other\\nsites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the \\nnewsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in \\ntheir source distributions of X11.\\n\\n\\tPeople without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. It now has \\n23 patches for X11R5 [3/93].  Send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the Subject line\\n\\t\\tsend fixes #\\nwhere # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.\\n\\n\\tHere are a few complications:\\n\\t1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request \"5a\", \"5b\", \"5c\" and \\n\"5d\" separately\\n\\t2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was \\nre-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn\\'t work with Solaris]\\n\\t3) fix 8 is in two parts: \"8a\" and \"8b\"\\n\\t4) fix 13 is in three parts: \"13a\", \"13b\", and \"13c\"\\n\\t5) fix 16 is in two parts: \"16a\" and \"16b\"\\n\\t6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which \\npreviously was optional\\n\\t7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff\\nby asking for \"PEXlib.uu.[1234]\".\\n\\t8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, \"22a\" through \"22i\"\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  59)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail \\nit a request, and it mails back the response.\\n\\tAny of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. The\\nxstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything, so you can \\nhave several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help). \\nThe xstuff server treats the \"Subject:\" header line just like any other line \\nof the message.\\n\\tThe archives are organized into a series of directories and \\nsubdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an \\nindex. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the \\nsubdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.\\n\\n\\t1) The command \"help\" or \"send help\" causes the server to send you a \\nmore detailed version of this help file.\\n\\t2) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"index\", then \\nthe server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive. If\\nthere are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories, then \\nthe indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level index. \\nFor example, you can say \"send index fixes\" (or \"index fixes\"). A message that \\nrequests an index cannot request data.\\n\\t3) if your message contains a line whose first word is \"send\", then the\\nxstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. To name \\nan item, you give its directory and its name. For example\\n                send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9\\n\\tYou may issue multiple send requests. The xstuff server contains many \\nsafeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large \\namounts of data. The mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed\\namount of data each day. If the work queue contains more requests than the \\nday\\'s quota, then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day. \\nWhenever the mailer is run to send its day\\'s quota, it sends the requests out \\nshortest-first.\\n\\t4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting \\nreturn addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won\\'t get any response.  If \\nyou happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like\\n        path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu\\nor\\n        path bar!foo!frotz\\nin the body of your message, and the daemon will use it.\\n\\n\\tThe xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu.

       "  '----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOpen letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for\\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDear sir:\\n\\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine\\'s publication\\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \\nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\\nserious studies by criminologists.\\n\\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \\neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\\norder.\\n\\n\\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \\n\\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\\n\\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\\n\\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\\n\\tcontention.\\n\\t\\n\\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\\n\\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\\n\\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\\n\\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\\n\\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\\n\\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\\n\\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\\n\\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\\n\\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\\n\\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\\n\\t\\n\\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada\\'s gun law,\\n\\tcompared to Washington State\\'s. But they do not examine at all\\n\\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\\n\\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\\n\\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\\n\\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\\n\\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\\n\\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\\n\\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\\n\\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\\n\\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\\n\\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\\n\\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\\n\\t\\n\\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\\n\\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\\n\\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\\n\\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\\n\\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\\n\\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\\n\\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\\n\\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver\\'s homicide\\n\\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\\n\\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\\n\\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\\n\\t\\n\\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\\n\\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\\n\\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\\n\\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\\n\\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\\n\\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\\n\\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\\n\\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\\n\\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\\n\\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\\n\\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\\n\\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\\n\\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\\n\\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\\n\\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\\n\\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\\n\\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook\\'s gun\\n\\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\\n\\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\\n\\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\\n\\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\\n\\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\\n\\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\\n\\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\\n\\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\\n\\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\\n\\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\\n\\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\\n\\tVancouver.\\n\\t\\n\\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\\n\\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\\n\\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\\n\\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\\n\\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\\n\\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\\n\\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\\n\\tthe case.\\n\\t\\n\\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\\n\\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\\n\\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \\n\\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\\n\\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\\n\\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\\n\\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\\n\\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\\n\\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\\n\\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\\n\\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\\n\\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\\n\\tmost factors related to crime control.\\n\\t\\n\\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\\n\\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\\n\\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\\n\\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\\n\\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\\n\\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\\n\\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\\n\\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\\n\\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\\n\\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\\n\\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\\n\\tinvolving firearms.\\n\\t\\n\\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\\n\\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\\n\\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\\n\\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\\n\\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\\n\\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\\n\\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\\n\\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\\n\\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\\n\\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\\n\\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\\n\\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\\n\\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \\n\\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\\n\\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\\n\\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\\n\\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\\n\\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\\n\\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\\n\\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\\n\\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\\n\\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\\n\\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\\n\\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\\n\\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\\n\\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tREFERENCES\\n\\n1.

Wright\\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\\n\\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \\n   community.\"\\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\\n   Why?\\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\\n   that Vancouver\\'s handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \\n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook\\'s gun prevalence index,\" which stands\\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook\\'s index\\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \\n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\\n*  Cook\\'s index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \\n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\\n   The authors attribute Seattle\\'s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain\\'s low rate of\\n   violent crime was a function of that nation\\'s strict gun laws and the \\n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \\n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \\n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\\n*  Vancouver\\'s minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study\\'s breakdown of homicide rates\\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\\n*  in either city.\\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \\n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \\n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \\n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty\\'s minority population?  (The city\\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \\n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\\n   percentage?\\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \\n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\\n*  Vancouver\\'s population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle\\'s racial\\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \\n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \\n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \\n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\\n   is cause for further concern.\\n\\n   [James D.

On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\\nthe following to the WSJ.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\\n\\nPreston K. Covey\\n\\n\\n\\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \\n \\n\\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \\nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\\nhere. \\n\\n\\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\\ntake the bus?  \\n\\n\\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\\n\\n\\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\\nhomes unaccounted.\\n\\n\\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\\nsix counts:\\n\\n\\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\\ncriminological hogwash.\\n\\n\\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\\ncrucially affect the risk. \\n\\n\\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \\nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\\ndisregard this issue.\\n\\n\\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \\nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \\n\\n\\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\\n\\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \\n\\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \\n\\n\\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \\nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\\n',\n",

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \\nassistant general counsel. He became the league\\'s chief legal officer in \\nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

About the WORST that can happen\\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\\n\\nMost revolvers are more \\'fragile\\' then semi auto\\'s.

       "  'This kind of argument cries for a comment...\\n\\n\\n \\n: >>...God did not create\\n: >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns.\\n: > \\n: >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is\\n: >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of\\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \\n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\\n\\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \\n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \\n: \\n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\\n: cannot *know* that.\\n\\nI hope you don\\'t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \\neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n: >>diseases/disorders.\\n\\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\\n\\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\\n  \\n: Oh, I admit it\\'s not perfect (yet).  But I\\'m working on it.  :)\\n\\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\\n\\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\\'t explain\\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\\n\\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\\n: of biology and genetics, although I\\'m sure I\\'d find it a\\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\\n: environment.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\\n\\nTry reading P.W.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\\n\\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\\n\\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has\\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\\ncommercial use today.\\n\\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \\n\\nA \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the\\n\"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\\n\\n\\n                                2\\n\\n\\n\"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government\\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\\nin two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the\\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\\nwiretap.\\n\\nThe \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no\\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\\nconversations of Americans.\\n\\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\\ntheir findings.\\n\\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\\nencryption\\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other\\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\\n\\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\\n\\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\\n\\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\\n          technology to build the National Information\\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\\n          marketplace; and \\n\\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\\n          high technology products.\\n\\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                3\\n\\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\\n(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV\\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\\'s telephone\\nsystem transmits voice.\\n\\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\\nprotect all Americans\\' right to privacy while also protecting\\nthem from those who break the law.\\n\\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \\nThe provisions of the President\\'s directive to acquire the new\\nencryption technology are also available.  \\n\\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n\\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\\'S\\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\\n\\nA:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with\\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\\n     conversations of Americans.\\n\\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\\n     decipher the message?\\n\\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\\n     escrow system.\\n\\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\\n\\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\\n\\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\\n     how strong the security is?  \\n\\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\\n     vulnerabilities.\\n\\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\\n\\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\\n     officials.\\n\\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\\n\\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\\n     decisions related to this initiative.\\n\\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\\n\\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\\n     manufacturer that produces them.\\n\\nQ:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?\\n\\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\\n     to other vendors in the future.\\n\\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \\n\\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\\n     the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.\\n     \\nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\\n     powerful encryption devices?\\n\\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\\n     developing.\\n\\n     The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption\\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\\n     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have\\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every\\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a\\n     false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is\\n     an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper\\n     Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.\\n\\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\\n     Administration\\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \\n\\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\\'\\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\\n     and terrorism.\\n\\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\\n     the government hardware?',\n",

You simply can\\'t, and the administration\\nknows it.

I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\\n \\nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\\n \\nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\\n \\nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\\n \\nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\\n \\nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can\\'t believe it\\'s happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\\n \\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMost Concerned,\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Signature]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\\nuni@acs.bu.edu\\n',\n",

So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\\n##it)?  \\n##\\n\\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\\nscience.

Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata.

The individual\\'s belief in some dogmatic religion is a \\nsymptom of that irrationality.\\n\\n\\nAtheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An\\natheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy\\nof religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists\\namong the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one\\'s\\nreligious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher\\nmust not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may\\nbe non-religious was a secondary point.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.\\n\\nScience does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma:\\nskepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that \\nwonderful little creature known as the \"theory.\"  Many of us believe in\\nthe theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this \\ntheory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it \"makes more \\nsense than...?\"  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.\\n\\n\\n\\nIdeally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge\\nthat scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some\\nscientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the\\nflaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed\\nto spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof \\nfor the theory.  Remember cold fusion?\\n\\n\\n\\nNot really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco\\ncrisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome.\\nMy point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was\\nin Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up),\\nand the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the\\nnumber of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the\\nnumber of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and\\nyou will see my point.\\n',\n",

       "  'John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\\n  a mystical `organizing principle\\' of life, using the similarity of organs\\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\\n\\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\\'t\\nsurprise me much.  It\\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\\nhe only posted a quote).\\n',\n",

Oh, okay Charles,\\nthat makes a lot of sense.  I tell you what Charles, I\\'ll call the Heart\\nFoundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational\\nand that they can all go home because they are addressing the LESSER CAUSES\\nof death.  And you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation\\nand diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.\\nPlease, quit wasting my time with this silly shit Charles.\\n \\nI\\'ve got an idea Charles, why don\\'t you start a talk.politics.caraccidents\\ngroup or talk.politics.fall group?  This is talk.politics.guns.  Don\\'t\\nconfuse the issue.  Just because a social problem may not claim as many\\nvictims as another, we should not try to address it?  I don\\'t agree.\\nI\\'m not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of\\nchildhood deaths. I am really getting frigging sick of having to respond\\nto the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who\\nwants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths\\nis trying to make a political issue out of it.\\n \\n \\n Again Charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context\\nfor your own purposes.  The statement that you responded to above is actually\\nin reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed\\nconcern over making youth gun violence a priority.  I guess, maybe Humane\\nperson and Rational person could be interchangeable huh? Both would be defined\\nas \"a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest\\nnumber of childhood deaths.\"  If that is the case, I\\'m extremely glad that I\\nam inhumane and irrational.\\n \\nSorry Charles, the FBI Uniform Crime Report is WELL known for misrepresenting\\nthe facts.  But if you insist, according to the 1990 UCR, \"Firearm murders\\nof youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990\"\\n \\nIs the National Center for Health Statistics good enough for you?  They state\\nthat \"Every day, 12 American children ages 19 and under are killed in gun\\naccidents, suicides, and homicides.  Many more are wounded\".\\n \\nOr how about the National Pediatric Trauma Registry?  They say \"Gunshot\\nwounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas\\nbetween 1987 and 1990.\"\\n \\nDo you also doubt the American Academy of Pediatrics Charles???  They state\\nthat \"Gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from\\n1986 to 1988.\"\\n \\nCharles, I hope you don\\'t need to be convinced that youth are increasingly\\nvictims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  If you don\\'t\\nrealize this fact, (I don\\'t care if you go by CDC or FBI data, or if you go\\ninto the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll\\nby yourself), I\\'m not going to bother to try to convince you.  Its obvious\\nthat you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion\\nand that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political\\ndiscussion.  I really don\\'t want to do that.\\n \\n Charles, it\\'s obvious that you know nothing about the CDC.\\nThey don\\'t just study cancer and heart disease.  I\\'ve got news for you,\\ninterpersonal gun violence IS an epidemic.  In 1984, Surgeon General\\nC. Everett Koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health\\nproblem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.\\n \\n \\nWHO THE F**K SAID ANYTHING ABOUT TEACHING CHILDREN TO SAFELY HANDLE\\nFIREARM CHARLES??? In the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump\\ninto a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1\\nsentence that you decide to respond to. What the hell are you saying here???\\nYou\\'re wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control\\nissue out of a discussion that isn\\'t.\\nCharles buddy, I\\'m getting really tired of this.  Do you live on the planet\\nMars???  As a physicist, I realize that you probably don\\'t come into contact\\nwith many youth, but I REALLY think you need to make a trip to your local\\nurban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  In addition\\nspend a few minutes talking to these kids.  Ask them if they have ever heard\\ngunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,\\nwhether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and\\nwhether they themselves have ever been shot.\\n \\nBelieve me Charles, THAT will be your *INDEPENDENT* VERIFICATION.',\n",

       "  '\\nWell, they can\\'t listen in on much of mine, since I already use\\ncryptography for much of my electronic mail, and will start using it\\nfor my telephony as soon as practical.\\n\\nHowever, allow me to tell a parable.\\n\\nThere was once a far away land called Ruritania, and in Ruritania\\nthere was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in\\nRuritainia were transparent. Now, in the days when people had lived in\\nmud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood\\ntechnology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in\\nRuritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until\\nthis point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on\\nsomeone\\'s home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being\\na civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars\\nand watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,\\nwould get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going\\non. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but\\neveryone pretended that this didn\\'t happen.\\n\\nOne day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,\\nsuddenly the police couldn\\'t watch all your actions at will. Things\\nwould go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely\\nprivate.\\n\\nIndignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have\\nvideo cameras installed in every nook and cranny. \"After all\", they\\nsaid, \"with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing\\nvideo cameras doesn\\'t mean that the police get any new capability --\\nthey are just keeping the old one.\"\\n\\nA wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the\\nlives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the\\nmud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that\\nRuritania was a civilized country where not everything that was\\nexpedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it\\nhad been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to\\nsolve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its\\nexpedience. Indeed, \"why have warrants at all\", he asked, \"if we are\\ninterested only in expedience?\"\\n\\nA famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She\\nnoted that people might take photographs of children masturbating\\nshould the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,\\nand the law was passed.\\n\\nSoon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths\\nwhile speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading\\ntheir lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the\\npolice said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their\\nlawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never\\nbefore been allowed to listen in on people\\'s homes, but Dorothy\\nQuisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of\\ncovering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and\\nmutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused\\nof being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one\\nwanted to interfere in people\\'s rights to wear what they liked, so a\\ncompromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with\\nmicrophones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man\\nlamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old\\nlip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were\\ninstalled everwhere.\\n\\nHowever, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent\\ncitizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of\\nthem would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not\\nunderstand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at\\nall times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that\\nthey speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. \"After all\",\\nDorothy Quisling pointed out, \"they might be using the opportunity to\\nspeak in private to mask terrorist activities!\"  Terrorism struck\\nterror into everyone\\'s hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of\\nthis new law.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all\\nof this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which\\nall Ruritanians were proud. \"Why\", he asked, \"are we obligated to\\nsacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police\\neasier? There isn\\'t any real evidence that this makes any big dent in\\ncrime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!\"\\n\\nHowever, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law\\nrequired, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a\\nmicrophone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived\\nand took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture\\nwas, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been\\nrecently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene\\nthoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the\\nmajor problems of the new age of plenty and joy.\\n\\n--\\nPerry Metzger\\t\\tpmetzger@shearson.com',\n",

       "  '\\nWow! You got me thinking now!\\n\\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \\nmove in society to classify previously \"socially unacceptable\" yet legal \\nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \\ncoexisting methods of social control.\\n\\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \\nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \\nof punishments.\\n\\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \\nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \\nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \\nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \\nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \\nsocial censure.\\n\\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \\n\"morality\".  I\\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\\'t for \\nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \\nabsolutely impossible.\\n\\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \\nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\\'t \\nillegal, then don\\'t pick on me).  I\\'m not saying this is wrong, merely \\nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\\n\\n\\t1) A high education level,\\n\\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\\n\\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\\n\\t4) A \"me\" oriented culture.\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \\nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\\\\ncan\\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \\nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \\nthose freedoms don\\'t impinge on another\\'s.\\n\\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \\nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \\nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \\ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \\ncontinued destabilization of society.  \\n\\nI got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this \\nmess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms \\nin order to \"stabilize\" society.  Yet I believe development of societies \\nfollow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a \\nsocial model which maximizes indiv. freed.\\'s yet is stable?

It will \\nbe hello next year.\\n\\nThe key for the remaining games in the series will be whether Fuhr can\\nkeep up his brillliant goaltending and if Mogilny can continue skate by \\nthe Bruins.  He has shown demonstrated excellent speed.\\n\\nFinally, the Sabres appear to have shown up for the post season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '[ . . .]\\n\\nI am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you\\nphrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of \"right\"\\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n\\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\\n\\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.

Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that\\nDavid Koresh had \"explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40\\nfeet into the air.\"  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of\\nopportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the\\nfirst place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas\\ninto the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren\\'t living in a\\nfortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because\\nit was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn\\'t\\nthey do this?  Could it be that they didn\\'t have any explosives or\\nsimilar munitions?  I just don\\'t buy what the ATF and FBI have been\\nsaying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.\\n\\nHere\\'s something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some\\ntime an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that\\nthis was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I\\ndon\\'t think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this\\nso-called \"explosion\" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.\\nWe figure that this is what it was because of how the \"explosion\"\\nlooked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn\\'t due to something like TNT,\\ndynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion\\nin the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something\\nthat looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.\\n\\nIsn\\'t it curious that the ATF wasn\\'t very forthcoming about how the four\\nofficers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that\\nsome of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown\\nby the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about\\nwhether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they\\nsaid that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN\\'T READY TO RELEASE\\nTHE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?\\nPerhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the\\ncause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.\\n\\nWhat is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the\\ncompound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade\\nbody during one of the lawyer\\'s visits to the compound.  Later on\\nthe lawyer gave the grenade body (I don\\'t know if it was a dud or a\\nspent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this\\ngrenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only\\npeople we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn\\'t it be\\na shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,\\nor explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their\\nface then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the\\nrubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won\\'t investigate until the\\nATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to\\nmake sure that others \"find\" what they want for them to \"find\" if\\nyou know what I mean.

I understand; but you know what I mean.\\nThink of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases \\nrequired to get the precise idea across.  \\n\\nLastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as\\nyou can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  \\n\\n---------------\\n\\nWhere would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum \\n\\tTheism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  \\nFeel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  \\n\\n\\nIn what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe \\nin the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume \\nthat the answer to this is \"yes;\" if you\\'ve always been an atheist, or at\\nleast never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)\\n\\n\\nHow serious was your/your family\\'s involvement?  \\n\\nHow and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  \\n\\nHow and when did your \"final break\" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I \\nrealize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an \"event\" per se;\\nwhatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  \\n\\n\\nWhat contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)\\nyour \"conversion\" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism\\ncounts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  \\n\\nTo what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your\\nbeliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through\\nindependent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  \\n\\n\\nAre you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational\\nmeans (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least \\nin part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  \\n\\n\\nTo what extent do you feel you \"understand\" the universe through your beliefs?\\nWhat phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical\\nphenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you \\nfeel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as \\nan explanatory method?  \\n\\nWhat would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would\\nconvince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the \\nplausibility of God\\'s existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs\\n-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for\\nsome time?  \\n\\nAre you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you\\nthink science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science\\nwas the new \"secular religion,\" and that \"scientists are, in a very real sense,\\nthe new priesthood.\"  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-\\nreligious base, or even a religious element?)  \\n\\n---------------\\n\\nThis survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but\\nalso to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose\\nideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have\\nme, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your\\nbeliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  \\n\\n---------------\\n\\nThanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what\\nI\\'m doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what\\nI\\'ve asked about above.  ',\n",

(Of course, this was\\nall set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy\\nconclusion.)  So, yesterday I went to hear him.  What follows is a rough\\nsummary of what I think I heard him say, which should not be taken as\\nexactly what he actually said...\\n\\nKates started by saying that since he didn\\'t know any more about the fire\\nthan the audience did (it had just happened the day before), he would not\\ndiscuss that, but would concentrate on the original raid.\\n\\nKoresh definitely was not playing with a full deck.  But so what?  This\\nisn\\'t the first time that the leader of a new, small religious group has\\nbeen ridiculed by the public.  Extreme religious views nearly always fuel\\nhatred and mistrust.  The first amendment applies, maybe especially, to\\npeople like Koresh.\\n\\nLengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the US.\\nThere were none until about 1830, when they began in metropolitan areas.\\nPolice originally were not armed; if they found a crime in progress, they\\ncalled local armed citizens to help.  Many began to carry arms for\\nprotection despite regulations against them, eventually the laws were\\nchanged to allow them to carry guns.  The original intent was to have many\\nsmall police departments, jealous of one another and competitive, but not\\nlarge enough to be a threat to liberty, hence the plethora of\\norganizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard.  When the\\nFBI was started, agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they\\nwere to be, after all, a bureau of investigation, not a police force).\\n\"All police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that\\npower.\"\\n\\nThe BATF started as a tax collection agency, whose primary job was to raid\\nillegal stills.  When the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners\\nno longer found their trade no longer profitable, many illegal stills\\ndisappeared, and the BATF needed something else to do to justify its\\nexistence, so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.\\nAround the time when the BATF\\'s annual budget is under review, the media\\nis alerted by the BATF to come to such-and-such a place, where at a\\npre-arranged time, a bunch of cars full of BATF agents roar up to the door\\nand the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a\\ngun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly.  The media isn\\'t\\ninvited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork, but\\nif any irregularities are found, the media gets to cover the agents\\nremoving armfuls of guns from the premises, and the luckless FFL in\\nchains.\\n\\nThe Waco incident happened a few weeks before BATF\\'s budget was up for\\nreview.\\n\\nKates\\' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad, and\\nthat the BATF never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot\\nat, or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100\\nagents over open ground with no cover, for example), and would have had\\nsome medical personnel on hand.\\n\\nHe confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for Koresh\\'s arrest\\nin connection with a murder charge, and the local sheriff called him on\\nthe phone and explained about it.  Koresh sais, ok, come pick me up, and\\nthe sheriff did, temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could\\nbe tested.  Koresh was later cleared, release, and presumably got his guns\\nback.  At least at that time, he was rational enough to be approached\\nrationally, and behaved in a reasonable manner.\\n\\nThe BATF didn\\'t take into account that, unlike most of the FFL\\'s they\\naudit, Koresh was actually paranoid, and fostered paranoia in his\\nfollowers.  Thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them, and\\nthey reacted accordingly.\\n\\nWith respect to the original warrant, it had not been unsealed when Kates\\nwas giving his talk, so he could not comment on it, except to mention that\\nthe BATF has been known to not double-check the veractiy of their\\ninformants, if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant.  He had\\nmore to say about the way the warrant was served, which may have been\\ncompletely illegal.  Apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to\\nknock on the door and announce that you\\'re an officer with a warrant for\\nthus-and-so; if they don\\'t open the door and the evidence is flushable,\\nthen it is ok to break in the door.  But since it is hard to flush guns\\ndown the toilet, there may have been no justification for the BATF\\nbreaking in the way they did.  If the constitutional rights of the\\nDavidians were violated by an invalid warrant, or by an improperly served\\nwarrant, then the Davidians may have been justified in their actons.  A\\nclose look at one of the original films shows that one BATF agent _may_\\nhave shot himself by accident when entering the building; if so, this was\\nthe first shot fired!\\n\\nThe role of the media could have been a whole lot worse.  After an initial\\nposition on the side of the BATF, the media began to come around to the\\nview that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held\\noff a bad, possibly illegal attack.  A real cynic might say that the FBI\\nwent in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was\\nbeginning to change sides, and the FBI wanted to act before they lost the\\npublic\\'s sympathy.\\n\\nShould the BATF be abolished?  No.  Police agencies _should_ be numerous,\\ndiverse, inefficient, decentralized, etc.  Better a few inept accidents\\nlike this, than a move toward a single, large, well-organized,\\nwell-trained, powerful, domestic police force, which would eventually have\\neven more tragic results.\\n\\n   - Lyn Bates\\n     (bates@bbn.com)\\n\\nPS Don Kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at Boston\\nCollege Law School next Tuesday, April 27.

       "  '\\nFrom _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an\\nintroduction to the article \"Joseph Smith and the Book of\\nMormon\", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by\\nPaul Kurtz. \\n\\n\\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n\\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\\n\\tthe world\\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as\\n\\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\\'s\\n\\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one\\n\\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\\n\\tcountries.\\n\\t\\n\\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\\n\\tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\\n\\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\\n\\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of\\n\\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\\n\\tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\\n\\tpornography, sexual freedom, women\\'s rights, and other, in\\n\\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\\n\\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\\n\\t\\n\\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\\n\\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western\\n\\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\\n\\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\\n\\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\\n\\tgovernment officials.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\\n\\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\\n\\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\\n\\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\\n\\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by\\n\\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews\\n\\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\\n\\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\\n\\thave been baptized in the \"true church\" will be reunited\\n\\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\\n\\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\\n\\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\\n\\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\\n\\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\\n\\t\\n\\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\\n\\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\\n\\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\\n\\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\\n\\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\\n\\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\\n\\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\\n\\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \\n\\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\\n\\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\\n\\tin nineteenth-century America.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\\n\\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\\n\\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\\n\\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\\n\\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\\n\\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\\n\\tis dangerous to the faith.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\\n\\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\\n\\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\\n\\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\\n\\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\\n\\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\\n\\thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\\n\\t\\n\\nThe article itself is super.',\n",

       "  'WOULD WIRETAP CHIP BE COST-EFFECTIVE?\\n\\n                        by Robin Hanson\\n                     Draft, April 21, 1993\\n\\n  SUMMARY: Compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars,\\n  wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police.  So the\\n  proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part \\n  in three thousand to be cost-effective. \\n\\nBACKGROUND\\n\\nUntil now, phones have happened to allow the existence of \"wiretaps\",\\ndetectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line.  And over\\ntime, law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to\\naid in criminal investigations.  However, powerful new encryption\\ntechnologies threaten this status quo, by making possible truly\\nprivate communication.  A small chip in each phone could soon make it\\nliterally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical\\nmicrophones at either end.\\n\\nIn order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap\\nphone conversations, the U.S. government announced on April 16, 1993\\nthat it had developed and begun manufacturing a special \"wiretap\" chip\\nto be placed in future phones, instead of the total privacy chips\\nwhich have been under private development.  The same day, AT&T\\nannounced it would use these chips \"in all its secure telephone\\nproducts\".\\n\\nEach chip would be created under government supervision, when it would\\nbe given a fixed indentifier and encryption key.  Periodically during\\neach conversation, the chip would broadcast its identifier and other\\ninfo in a special \"law enforcement block\".  Law enforcement officers\\nwith a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the\\nindentifier from special trust agencies, and could thereby listen in\\non any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.\\n\\nTo date, most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its\\nsecurity.  The government won\\'t disclose the encryption algorithm, and\\nmany suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it\\nhas claimed.  The track record of previous governments does not\\ninspire confidence on this point [1].\\n\\nHowever, this paper will neglect these concerns, and ask instead\\nwhether this new wiretap chip is a cost-effective tool for police\\ninvestigation.  That is, which is a cheaper way for society to\\ninvestigate crime: force phone communications to support wiretaps, or\\ngive police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways?\\nOr to put it another way, would police agencies be willing to pay for\\neach wiretap, if they had to pay their share of the full social cost\\nof forcing phones to support wiretaps?\\n\\nTo start to answer this question, we might compare the current\\nbenefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected\\ncosts of implementing the new wiretap chip plan.  And since current\\nbenefits are easier to estimate, we begin there.\\n\\nWIRETAP BENEFITS\\n\\n1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available\\n[2].  In that year, 872 wiretap installations were requested, and no\\nrequests were denied.  (This figure does not include wiretaps obtained\\nwith the consent of a party to the conversation.)  2057 arrests\\nresulted from wiretaps started the same year, 1486 arrests came from\\nwiretaps in previous years, and 55% of arrests led to convictions.\\n76% of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers, email, etc.), 60% were\\nregarding drug offenses, and 40% were requested by federal\\nauthorities.  Each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487\\ncalls, 22% of them incriminating, among 131 people, and cost an\\naverage of $45,125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations\\nreporting costs), mostly for labor.\\n\\nThus a total of about $40 Million was spent on wiretaps, to obtain\\nabout 4000 arrests, at $10,000 per arrest.  Thus these arrests are at\\nleast four times more expensive than the $2500 per arrest figure one\\ngets by dividing the $28 Billion spent by all police nationally by the\\ntotal 11 Million non-traffic arrests [3].  Thus the $30 Million per\\nyear spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police\\nexpenditures.  And if we divide this by the 138 Million phone \"access\"\\nlines in the country [3], we get about 23 cents spent per year per\\nphone line, or about two cents a month.\\n\\nIn general, we deter a given class of criminals through a combination\\nof a perceived probability of being caught and convicted, and some\\nexpected punishment level if convicted.  So the social value of having\\nwiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get\\nthe same criminal deterrence through other means.  If unable to\\nwiretap a particular suspect\\'s phone, police might instead use hidden\\nmicrophones, or investigate that suspect in other ways.  Or police\\nmight focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps.  Or\\nwe might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.\\n\\nIf we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be\\non average twice as expensive as wiretaps, then the annual social\\nbenefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level\\nof two cents a month per phone line.\\n\\nWIRETAP COSTS\\n\\nLet us for the moment optimistically assume that the US government\\nencryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would\\nhave offered instead, protecting our conversations from the spying\\nears of neighbors, corporations, and governments, both foreign and\\ndomestic.  Even so, the need to support wiretaps would add many\\nadditional costs to build and maintain our communication system.\\n\\nExtra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions,\\nincreasing traffic by some unknown percentage.  A special process must\\nbe used to add encryption keys to chips, while securely distributing\\nthese keys to special agencies, which must be funded and monitored.\\nThe chips themselves are designed by a military contractor, whose\\ndesign is to remain secret, and are manufactured through a special\\nprocess so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.\\n(Chips are now offered at the relatively high price of $30 a peice in\\nlots of 10,000 [4].)  Private encryption systems not supporting\\nwiretaps would require none of these extra costs.\\n\\nPerhaps most important, government degree would at least partially\\nreplace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to\\nbe represented, encrypted, and exchanged in our future phones.  It is\\nwidely believed that governments are less efficient than private\\nenterprise in procuring products and standards, though they may perhaps\\nperform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private\\nstandards.  How much less efficient is a matter of debate, some say\\nthey pay twice as much, while others might say only 10% more.    \\n\\nCurrently, a total of $96 Billion is spent as operating expenses of\\nU.S. phone companies [3], which comes out to about $60 per month per\\naccess line.  If we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per\\nmonth, we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even\\nas much as one part in 3000, then wiretaps are not cost effective!\\nAnd this doesn\\'t even include extra costs phone owners pay because\\ntheir encryption chips are more expensive.  Of course most phones\\nwouldn\\'t have encryption chips for a while, but the wiretap benefit\\nper phone is still the same, so this argument still applies.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nGiven this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the\\nphone system and the value of wiretaps, we can justify only the\\nslightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.\\nWhen the only modification required was to allow investigators in to\\nattach clips to phone wires, wiretap support may have been reasonable.\\nBut when we consider substantial modification, the burden of proof is\\nclearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs\\nwould really be less than the benefits.  \\n\\nIf consensus cannot be obtain on this cost/benefit estimate, a\\ncompromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a\\nrate of say five cents per month, a tax payable to police agencies\\nnationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.\\n\\n[1] The Invisible Weapon, Oxford Press, ISBN 0-19-506273-6\\n\\n[2] Report on Applications for Orders Authorizing or Approving the\\n    Interception of Wire, Oral, or Electronic Communications, 1990,\\n    Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, Washington, DC 20544.\\n\\n[3] U.S. Statistical Abstracts, 1992.  \\n\\n[4] Dorothy Denning, \"The Clipper Chip: A Technical Summary\",\\n    distributed to sci.crypt newsgroup April 21, 1993.

Judging from replies I received\\nabout my \"Semantics on t.p.g\" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g\\nassume that when CCW laws are asked about the person is asking about the\\npossibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  It would also follow that said\\nperson would get the CCW to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or\\nbusiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe Freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.

I admire Stewart for letting them go, but\\nProbert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I\\'ve never\\nseen Probert whine either (he doesn\\'t need to).  Now, if Probie\\ndecides to put Wendel through the boards, he\\'s probably gone, right?\\n\\n\\nThis was also bullshit.  But once again, no replay.  It was Rouse, btw. I\\'m\\nreally pissed that the linesmen didn\\'t correct the call either....it\\'s b.s.\\nwhen the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.  \\n\\n\\nYes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit\\nloss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the\\nWings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.\\n\\nThe call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his\\nstick in somebody\\'s eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I\\nhave seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he\\'s an\\nasshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. \\nMurray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out\\nof him.\\n',\n",

Where did you hear it?\\n\\n\\nUp to which moment?  The one where you decided that anyone who claims to be\\nGod no longer has the protection of the Constitution?\\nWhat happened to the separation of church and state?\\n\\n\\nI have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  From what I hear the\\n*original* warrant (the reason for the Feb. raid) is still sealed.  What are\\n\"unsealed\" seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.\\n\\n\\nFunny, I haven\\'t seen any of these \"interviews.\"\\nInteresting that when the social services agencies investigated Koresh on\\nthese previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.\\n\\n\\nFunny, I don\\'t remember hearing anything about childrens\\' statements,\\neither.  Where did you say you heard all this?\\n\\nWhat *I* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in\\nthe seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  This\\nfrom the newspaper and national TV news.\\n\\nDid you also hear that it\\'s the job of the BATF and the FBI to lay siege to\\nhomes where child abuse is suspected?  I thought you did.\\n\\n\\n\"Clearly?\"  Please tell us what Koresh was doing that can be construed as\\nother than \"minding his own business\" before the BATF raided the place.\\n\\n\\nYour logic just amazes me.  I think your grandparents who died in\\nAuschwitz would be turning over in their graves if they could hear how\\ncavalierly you throw away people\\'s protection of law because you think\\nthey\\'re \"scary\" and \"not the sort of person you\\'d want your daughter to\\ndate.\"  What sort of people do you suppose the Nazis thought your\\ngrandparents were?  Probably not the sort they\\'d want their little\\nfrauleins dating...\\n\\n\\nAnd next I suppose you\\'ll tell us exactly WHO these \"well-trained killers\"\\nhave killed?\\n\\n\\nBecause you said so, right?  Right.\\n\\n\\nSo someone with a different background, say someone who didn\\'t claim to be\\nthe Messiah, in your book COULD shoot and kill Federal Law Enforcement\\nofficials WOULD be a good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support?\\n\\n\\nWorth the paper it\\'s printed on.\\n\\nYou\\'re amazing, simply amazing.',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n\\n\\n[stuff deleted]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last year before Bryan Murray took over, the Wings did not make the\\nplayoffs.  While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques\\nDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,\\nembarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the \\nplayoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the\\nNorris).\\n\\nIt\\'s true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before \\nQuinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--\\ntougher division than the Norris, also known as the \"Snorris\", division.\\nVancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley\\nCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such \\npowerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force\\nin the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while\\nover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was \\neverybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just\\nto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a\\nlot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.\\n\\nBryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good\\nplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And\\nno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The\\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\\npossible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.\\n\\n\\nThere are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn\\'t in as bad a shape standings\\nwise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which\\nI outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with\\nat the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player\\ncannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I\\'m sure everyone\\nreading this will agree.  \\n\\nWe\\'ll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they\\nface each other in the conference final (assuming they don\\'t get knocked out,\\nlike last year).\\n',\n",

When they are set to japanese,\\n  the text gets truncated.  When they are set to english, everything\\n  works fine.

Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short \\nstories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.\\nHe wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than\\ntechnology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the\\ndeity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is\\nunable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.\\n\\n\"A Maze of Death\"\\nNoteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.\\n\\n\"VALIS\"\\nThe schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic\\nChristianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of\\nunknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and\\ndismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.\\n\\n\"The Divine Invasion\"\\nGod invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from\\nanother star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

Brown\\nSecretary\\nDepartment of Commerce\\n14th and Pennsylvania Ave., NW\\nWashington, DC 20236\\n\\nDear Secretary Brown:\\n\\n   As you know, I have long been interested in the privacy \\nand security of telecommunications transmissions and data in \\na networked environment.  Recent reports concerning the \\nAdministration\\'s endorsement of an electronic encryption \\nstandard, based upon \"clipper chip\" technology, have raised a \\nnumber of related issues.  The international competitiveness \\nof U.S. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is \\na key factor that the government should consider when \\naddressing issues of encryption and data security.  As the \\nnation moves forward in developing the national \\ncommunications and information infrastructure, security of \\ntelecommunications transmissions and network data will be an \\nincreasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of \\nusers.\\n\\n   The \"hacker\" community can compromise the integrity of \\ntelecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the \\nnetwork.  The people and businesses that use the nation\\'s \\ntelecommunications network and the personal computers linked \\nthrough it increasingly are demanding that information be \\nprotected against unauthorized access, alteration, and theft.\\n\\n   I am concerned that the Administration\\'s plan may mean \\nthat to remain competitive internationally, U.S. companies \\nwould be compelled to develop two products -- one for U.S. \\ngovernment customers, and another for private, commercial \\nusers who may want a higher encryption standard.  This may \\ninadvertently increase costs to those U.S. companies hoping \\nto serve both markets.  To assist the Subcommittee\\'s analysis \\nof this issue, please respond to the following questions:\\n\\n1. Has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the \\nAdministration been tested by any entity other than NSA, NIST \\nor the vendor?  If so, please identify such entities and the \\nnature of testing performed.  If not, please describe any \\nplans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how \\nsuch experts will be chosen.\\n\\n2. Under the Administration\\'s plan, what entities will be the \\nholders of the \"keys\" to decrypt scrambled data?  What \\nprocedures or criteria will the Administration utilize to \\ndesignate such key holders?\\n\\n3. Does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the \\nAdministration contain a \"trap door\" or \"back door,\" which \\ncould allow an agency or entity of the Federal government to \\ncrack the code?\\n\\n4. It is clear that over time, changes in technologies used \\nfor communications will require new techniques and additional \\nequipment.  How will encryption devices adapt to the rapid \\nadvancement of telecommunications technology?\\n\\n5. What additional costs would the proposed encryption place \\non the Federal government?  What is the estimated cost to \\nconsumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard \\nin their equipment?\\n\\n6. What is the Commerce Department\\'s assessment of the \\ncompetitive impact of the Administration\\'s endorsement of the \\n\"clipper chip\" technology on U.S. exports of computer and \\ntelecommunications hardware and software products?\\n\\n   I would appreciate your response by no later than close-\\nof-business, Wednesday, April 28, 1993.  If you have any \\nquestions, please have your staff contact Colin Crowell or \\nKaren Colannino of the Subcommittee staff at (202) 226-2424.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nEdward J.

The\\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\\neral reasons, outlined below:\\n\\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a \\ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to \\ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun \\nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\\ntrator.\\n\\nThe study actually refers to \\'acquaintances\\' rather\\nthan \\'friend\\'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\\nfriend.\\n\\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample \\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\\n\\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be \\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an \\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a \\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies \\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\\nused to commit suicide.\\n\\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can \\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.  One has\\nto consider carefully what questions were asked by\\nthose gathering the data before one can draw an accu-\\nrate conclusion from them.\\n\\nD.F.

Can\\'t you see past the bullshit?\\n\\n\\nCertainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the\\nanti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by\\nfirearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don\\'t use\\nthese deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  I\\'m\\nsorry if I jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning\\naccidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,\\nbut in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun\\ncontrol measures, I think the conclusion was a reasonable one.\\nThe fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may\\nbe, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.\\n\\n\\nSorry if it wasn\\'t clear to me.  I thought you were waffling on your view\\nof buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully\\npreventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  I have to disagree on\\nall these counts; I can\\'t understand how a buying guns from people who\\naren\\'t intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to\\ncommit crimes aren\\'t going to turn them in) could be construed as a\\npositive way for police to respond to \"interpersonal violence.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit\\nsuicide by HANDGUNS ALONE each year as the FBI says commit suicide by ALL\\nMETHODS per year?  Who do you think I should believe?  The people who call\\neveryone up to age 24 \"children\" when they\\'re screaming about the \"carnage\\nof our nation\\'s children\" being caused by handguns?\\n\\n\\nAh, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be\\nsuch a statistical problem that a stated objective in the Healthy People\\n2000 document is to \"enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of\\nhandguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the\\nlikelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?\"  The\\nagency that funded the \"study\" of DC which pronounced that the DC gun ban\\nhad saved X lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of\\na look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?\\nIt wasn\\'t their fault that the population of DC dropped in their \"post law\"\\nperiod...\\n\\n\\n\\nOkay, I\\'ll concede I no longer have the numbers I once read on these.  I\\'ll\\nretract my dispute of your numbers.  However, I would be greatly interested\\nin seeing how CPHV and CDC came up with these numbers.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s this got to do with anything?  Hell, when *I* was in elementary\\nschool I came home to an empty house with guns in it.  Why is this a\\nproblem?  I didn\\'t touch the guns - I had been taught not to.  I had also\\nbeen taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the\\ncar, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  The problem is not the guns,\\nit\\'s the parents!!!\\n\\n\\nAnd what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?\\nNOTHING.  No criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even\\nsuspension.  They take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say \"ain\\'t it\\nawful,\" and go on as if everything\\'s back to normal.  What\\'s wrong with\\nthis picture?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think Koresh was the Messiah, either... but isn\\'t it obvious that\\nif he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he\\nbelieved the children were much safer inside the compound?  I didn\\'t say\\nhe was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what\\nhe thought was going on.

Why is Kratz asking about what he told us that he knows?\\n\\nIs Kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from\\na two position switch via TV inspection?

The historicity of the episode doesn\\'t matter to what\\n follows]\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether I\\'m quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back\\nto current affairs,\\n\\n\\nAmong others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone\\nelse dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you\\nwill, known (according to Umar Khan) to \"Every Muslim school boy and\\ngirl\", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.\\n\\n\\nYes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing\\nabout a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing\\nthe actor \"Gibreel\" in the role of the angel whose name he took.\\nRushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims\\nor implies that this is what actually happened.  It\\'s somewhat like\\nstories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed\\nprostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the\\nArthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens\\nof others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,\\nconsider Salman Rushdie\\'s children\\'s book \"Haroun and the Sea of\\nStories\" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific\\nstoryteller -- works with existing story lines.\\n\\n\\nNo.  Muhammad\\'s [Mahound\\'s] integrity is not really impugned in this\\npart of the story, and there\\'s no reason to think this was Rushdie\\'s\\nintent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and\\nsatanic), though he doesn\\'t know their provenance.  It is not implied\\n(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:\\n\\n    \" *Not my voice* I\\'d never know such words I\\'m no classy speaker\\n    never was never will be but this isn\\'t my voice it\\'s a Voice.\\n      Mahound\\'s eyes open wide, he\\'s seeing some kind of vision,\\n    staring at it, oh, that\\'s right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He\\'s\\n    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don\\'t\\n    know, can\\'t say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my\\n    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.\\n      Being God\\'s postman is no fun, yaar.\\n      Butbutbut: God isn\\'t in this picture.\\n      God knows whose postman I\\'ve been.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?\\nOr something else?  The answer is not given.\\n\\nTo be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the\\nrole of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss\\nof faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,\\nbut this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very\\nexistence of a newsgroup named \"alt.atheism\" raises the same\\nquestions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is\\nthe real relevance.  If Rushdie\\'s mild fictional exploration is \"filth\\nand lies\", and he \"asked for what he got\", are we next on the fatwa\\nlist?

What they\\'d like to do is:\\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\\npainted.\\n\\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn\\'t be  transmitted\\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn\\'t help at all.  Instead, there would have to\\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\\nask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\\n(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\\n\\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it\\'s be nice\\nto hear about it.

       "  'NO SURRENDER!\\nDelivered by Lenda Jackson at the RKBA Rally in Denver, April 18, 1993\\n\\nIt is a fact of modern life that urban residents, particularly women, feel\\nthreatened. A certain number of them actually are threatened. There are\\nimmediate threats, the things that women will tell you they\\'re afraid\\nof. The noise downstairs at night. The lonely walk to the car. The\\nstranger at the door. The abusive husband, finally kicked out of the\\nhouse as he threatens to hurt her and their children. The burglar... The\\nmugger...the rapist. \\n\\nAnd what are we told is the solution? Move. Get a dog. Keep the door\\nlocked. Call the police. as a next-to-last resort, learn martial arts. and\\nalways, there\\'s the implied question \"what\\'s a pretty little thing like\\nyou doing without a husband around to protect you?\\n\\nBut what if you don\\'t like dogs? Like living alone? Don\\'t have 10\\nyears to devote learning judo?\\n\\nWhat if, after examining the facts, a woman learns that \"rape victims\\nusing armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed -\\nand were less likely to be injured(Kleck,124) than those using any\\nother form of resistance (Kleck,126) (also true for\\nrobbery/assault)(Kleck,123) \\n\\nWhat if, to our horror and despair, we find that citizens cannot depend\\non the police for effective protection - they usually respond after a\\ncrime has been committed. In truth, the Supreme Court has held that\\nthe police are not responsible for protecting any individual, only the\\nwhole community.\\n\\nAs a society, are we going to ask women, once again, to sacrifice\\nthemselves? Are we going to continue to deny women the ability to\\nhelp themselves?\\n\\nHere\\'s a thought. Neil Smith, in his book The Probability Broach, says\\n\"no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110-\\npound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out.\" But if\\na woman decides to protect herself, with the easiest, most efficient\\nmeans possible, people - especially other women - are horrified.\\n\"Eughh, how could you? I\\'d be terrified!\" they ask. How could you\\nhurt someone? They\\'ll repeat the lie: it\\'ll just get taken away from\\nyou. In truth, 1% of \"defensive gun uses\" result in the offender taking\\nthe gun away from the victim.(122,Kleck)\\n\\nWell, despite the lies, and the social pressure, some of us have already\\nmade that hard choice. We\\'ve decided that we are not going to be\\nvictimized by the muggers, burglars or rapists. We\\'re buying more\\nguns than every before. We\\'re learning how to use them - and teaching\\nothers, women and men, how to use them. Most importantly, we are\\npreparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.\\nWe\\'re taking our own security, literally, into our own hands. We\\'re\\ngoing to stop begging and pleading and marching and WHAT WE\\nINTEND IS TO REALLY TAKE BACK THE NIGHT.\\n\\nBut there\\'s another threat, more insatiable than any mugger, more\\nsecretive than any burglar, more soul-destroying than any rapist.\\n\\nThat menace is government, and it threatens us all. We know that\\ngovernments, throughout time, have suppressed rights and oppressed\\npeople. It\\'s the way they survive.\\n\\nIn our names and with our money, it interferes with innocent people\\nboth at home and abroad. It lies to us, cheats us, steals from us and\\nthreatens us with violence. No one knows exactly what it\\'ll do next -\\nwhat freedom we will lose because some government goon decides\\n\"it\\'s for your own safety\" or \"we know best\". Any person who acted\\nlike government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his\\nlife and locked up as a habitual offender.\\n\\nBut this monster called government persists, and grows. And we, who\\nshould be its masters, have become its unwilling slaves. Do you doubt\\nme? Then why did you file your income tax? \\n\\nLike any reasonable person, I believe that being afraid of something\\nthat can hurt you is smart, and that paranoia isn\\'t crazy if someone\\'s\\nreally after you. And make no mistake, they\\'re after you and they\\'re\\nafter me. Their names are familiar: Brady and Reynolds, Groff,\\nMetzenbahm, Moynihan, and Clinton. If we\\'re lucky, they\\'ll settle for\\nour assault rifles, our shotguns, our handguns and our ammunition. \\n\\nAs citizens, we have only two choices. They are the same two choices\\ngiven to women: to surrender or to fight. \\n\\nSurrender leads to the gulag, to the genocide of Pol Pot, to the\\ndisappearances, to Dachau. I do not intend to surrender. \\n\\nA battle can be philosophical or political: in the main, the people keep\\nthe government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. But if\\nthey have to, they will keep in mind the words of Thomas Jefferson:\\n\"the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.\"\\n\\nAs a patriot, I will point out the error in the government\\'s ways. I will\\ndo my best to vote the villains out of office. I will protest, and write,\\nand speak, and teach our children justice, honor and truth.

When atheists claim that they do -not- know if God exists and\\n: >don\\'t know what He wants, they contradict the Bible which clearly says\\n: >that -everyone- knows. The authority of the Bible is its claim to be\\n\\n: ...should I repeat what I wrote above for the sake of getting\\n: it across?  You may trust the Bible, but your trusting it doesn\\'t\\n: make it any more credible to me.\\n: If the Bible says that everyone knows, that\\'s clearly reason\\n: to doubt the Bible, because not everyone \"knows\" your alleged\\n: god\\'s alleged existance.\\n\\nAgain I am paraphrasing Christian doctrine which is very clear on this\\npoint, your dispute is not with me ...\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: >refuted while the species-wide condemnation is justified. Those that\\n: >claim that there is no evidence for the existence of God or that His will is\\n: >unknown, must deliberately ignore the Bible; the ignorance itself is\\n: >no excuse.\\n\\n: 1) No, they don\\'t have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far\\n: from universally accepted.  The Bible is NOT a proof of god;\\n: it is only a proof that some people have thought that there\\n: was a god.  (Or does it prove even that?  They might have been\\n: writing it as series of fiction short-stories.  As in the\\n: case of Dionetics.)  Assuming the writers believed it, the\\n: only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.\\n: And that\\'s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the\\n: interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct.\\n\\n: 2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.\\n\\n: 3) Again, read the FAQ.\\n\\n1) Here again you miss the point. The Bible itself is not the point,\\nit\\'s what it contains. It makes no difference who accpets the Bible or\\neven who\\'s unaware of its existence, Christians hold that it applies\\nuniversally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate\\nand the same innate knowledge of God.\\n\\n2) See above\\n\\n3) If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ, we wouldn\\'t be\\nhaving this conversation.\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: >freedom. You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to\\n: >ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known\\n: >in both cases. That an atheist can\\'t accept the evidence means only\\n\\n: Bzzt...wrong answer!\\n: Gravity is directly THERE.  It doesn\\'t stop exerting a direct and\\n: rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it.  God, on the\\n: other hand, doesn\\'t generally show up in the supermarket, except\\n: on the tabloids.  God doesn\\'t exert a rationally undeniable influence.\\n: Gravity is obvious; gods aren\\'t.\\n\\nAs I said, the evidence is there, you just don\\'t accept it, here at\\nleast we agree.\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: >Secondly, human reason is very comforatble with the concept of God, so\\n: >much so that it is, in itself, intrinsic to our nature. Human reason\\n: >always comes back to the question of God, in every generation and in\\n\\n: No, human reason hasn\\'t always come back to the existance of\\n: \"God\"; it has usually come back to the existance of \"god\".\\n: In other words, it doesn\\'t generally come back to the xtian\\n: god, it comes back to whether there is any god.  And, in much\\n: of oriental philosophic history, it generally doesn\\'t pop up as\\n: the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces\\n: are and which ones are out there.  From a world-wide view,\\n: human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to\\n: be and/or what force(s) are currently in control.  A natural\\n: tendancy to believe in \"God\" only exists in religious wishful\\n: thinking.\\n\\nYes, human reason does always come back to the existence of God, we\\'re\\nhaving this discussion are we not?\\n\\nBill\\n\\n: >I said all this to make the point that Christianity is eminently\\n: >reasonable, that Divine justice is just and human nature is much\\n: >different than what atheists think it is. Whether you agree or not\\n\\n: YOU certainly are not correct on human nature.  You are, at\\n: the least, basing your views on a completely eurocentric\\n: approach.  Try looking at the outside world as well when\\n: you attempt to sum up all of humanity.\\n\\nWell this is interesting, Truth is to be determined by it politically\\ncorrect content. Granted it\\'s extremely unhip to be a WASP male, and\\nanything European is contemptable, but I thought this kind of\\ndialogue, the purpose of a.a, was to get at the truth of things.

The Blues caught a few breaks, without a doubt.\\nOne was the Referee constantly watching the Blackhawks, looking for reasons to\\ngive them penalties.  Second, The Blues first goal resulted because the puck\\nhit the linesman as the Blackhawks attempted to clear.  No linesman, no shot\\nfor Brett(I can redirect anything)Hull to redirect.  On another of St. Louis'\\ngoals, Belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone\\nwho didn't belong in the crease, which means it was a St. Louis player.\\nFinally, the overtime goal was caused because someone kept Belfour from getting back to the crease.

It reads:\\n\\nlarge - 1.  having more than usual power, capacity, or scope.    \\n        2.  exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.\\n\\nNow I have no idea how many letters Bettman may have gotten on the issue\\nor how many people may have signed them.  65 people may be up there, \\nthereby validating definition 2.  I would also wager that the geographical\\nrange of signatures is quite large, which would give it a large scope.\\n\\n\\nWhy would he be impressed with this unless it were \"large\"? \\n\\nI am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing\\nand are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear\\nyourself speak.  \\n\\nI personally don\\'t know whether or not I agree with the letter.

What is XFree86?\\n\\n   XFree86 is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which was distributed with\\n   X11R5.  This release consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and\\n   other enhancements.  Here are the highlights of the enhancements:\\n\\n    1) The SpeedUp package from Glenn Lai is an integral part of XFree86,\\n       selectable at run-time via the Xconfig file.  Some SpeedUps require\\n       an ET4000 based SVGA, and others require a virtual screen width of\\n       1024.  The SpeedUps suitable to the configuration are selected by\\n       default.  With a high-quality ET4000 board (VRAM), this can yield\\n       up to 40% improvement of the xStones benchmark over X386 1.2.\\n    2) The fX386 packages from Jim Tsillas are included as the default\\n       operating mode if SpeedUp is not selected.  This mode is now\\n       equivalent in performance to X386 1.1b (X11R4), and approximately\\n       20% faster than X386 1.2.\\n    3) Support for LOCALCONN, compile-time selectable for server, clients,\\n       or both.  This support is for both SVR3.2 and SVR4.  For SVR4.0.4\\n       with the \\'Advanced Compatibility Package\\', local connections from\\n       SCO XSight/ODT clients are supported.\\n    4) Drivers for ATI and Trident TVGA8900C and TVGA9000 SVGA chipsets.\\n       Refer to the files README.ati and README.trident for details about\\n       the ATI and Trident drivers.\\n    5) Support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (Thomas Eberhardt\\'s\\n       code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).\\n    6) Type1 Font code from MIT contrib tape has been included, and is\\n       compile-time selectable.  There are contributed Type1 fonts in the\\n       contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n    7) New configuration method which allows the server\\'s drivers and font\\n       renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary\\n       distributions.\\n    8) Integrated support for 386BSD, Mach, and Linux.\\n    9) A monochrome version of the server which will run on generic VGA\\n       cards is now included.\\n\\n   The following key features were added with the release of XFree86 1.2\\n   (they were not in XFree86 1.1):\\n\\n    1) The monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of\\n       available SVGA memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200 \\n       (see the X386(1) manual page for more information).\\n    2) Support for the Hercules mono card has been added to the\\n       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two\\n       headed\" server - one VGA, and one Hercules.  So far this has only\\n       been tested on SVR4 (it is also reported to work under Linux).\\n    3) SVR3 shared libraries, tested under ISC SVR3 2.2 and 3.0.1.\\n    4) Support for SVR4.2 (There are some special considerations to\\n       consider, due to new USL bugs; see the README.SVR4 file for\\n       more information.)\\n    5) Support for PS/2 mice, and Logitech MouseMan/TrackMan (some \\n       versions of these devices were not previously compatible).\\n    6) A new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor\\n       timing data, written by Eric Raymond (derived from previous\\n       documentation and a lot of experimentation).\\n    7) Greatly improved support for international keyboards, including\\n       implementation of the Compose key functionality found on many \\n       vendor servers (see the X386keybd(1) manual page for more \\n       information).\\n    8) The accuracy with which the server detects SVGA pixel clocks has\\n       been improved, and the timings are now stored at accuracies of\\n       0.1 MHz.  Users may want to consider removing an existing Clocks\\n       line from their Xconfig file and re-probing using the new server.\\n    9) Many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the Xconfig\\n       configuration file.  Error messages are much more informative\\n       and intuitive, and more validation is done.  There are many new\\n       options that can be enabled in the Xconfig file (see the X386(1) \\n       manual page for more information on the format of this file).\\n\\n       Plus a number of other small things.  Refer to the CHANGELOG file\\n       in the source distribution for full details.\\n\\n   Also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by Eric Raymond, and the\\n   current X386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by David Wexelblat.\\n\\n4. What OSs are supported?\\n\\n    XFree86 supports:\\n\\tSVR4.2: Consensys V4.2\\n\\tSVR4.0: Microport, Dell, Esix, ISC, AT&T, MST, Consensys, UHC\\n\\tSVR3: ISC 2.2 & 3.0, AT&T 2.2\\n\\tLinux, Mach 386, 386BSD 0.1\\n\\n\\tBSD/386 is not supported, but it should work. The most active\\n\\tBSD/386 person is Greg Lehey <grog@lemis.de>.\\n\\n\\tNote that Esix 3.2D and SCO are not supported yet,\\n\\tbut anyone should feel free to submit patches.\\n\\tIf you are interested in tackling this, send mail to\\n\\txfree86@physics.su.oz.au\\n\\n5. What video hardware is supported?\\n\\n   At this time, XFree86 1.2 supports the following SVGA chipsets:\\n\\n\\tTseng ET4000\\n\\tTseng ET3000\\n\\tParadise PVGA1\\n\\tWestern Digital WD90C00, WD90C10, WD90C11 (these are supersets of\\n\\t\\tthe PVGA1, and use its driver)\\n\\tGenoa GVGA\\n\\tTrident TVGA8900C, TVGA9000\\n\\tATI 18800, 28800\\n\\n\\tAll of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\\n\\twith the exception of the ATI chipsets, which are only supported in\\n\\t256 color mode.\\n\\n\\tThe monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of\\n\\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the Hercules card.  On the\\n\\tET3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\\n\\tserver, and the GVGA has not been tested with more than 64k.\\n\\n\\tIt appears that some of the SVGA card manufacturers are going to\\n\\tnon-traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock frequencies.  To\\n\\tavoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes XFree86\\n\\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\\n\\tclock.  This allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are\\n\\tdiscovered.  Refer to the README.clkprog file for information on how\\n\\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  If you do develop such\\n\\ta program, the XFree86 team would be interested in including it with\\n\\tfuture XFree86 releases.\\n\\n\\tIf you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using XFree86,\\n\\tit is suggested that you purchase an ET4000-based board such as the\\n\\tOrchid ProDesigner IIs.  Avoid recent Diamond boards; XFree86 will not\\n\\twork with them, because Diamond won\\'t provide programming details.\\n\\tIn fact, the XFree86 project is actively not supporting new Diamond\\n\\tproducts, as long as such policies remain in effect.  Contributions\\n\\tof code will NOT be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).\\n\\tIf you would like to see this change, tell Diamond about it.\\n\\n\\tSome people have asked if XFree86 would work with local bus or EISA\\n\\tvideo cards. Theoretically, the means of communication between the\\n\\tCPU and the video card is irrelevant to Xfree86 compatibility. It\\n\\tcould be ISA, EISA, or local bus.  What should matter is the chipset\\n\\ton the video card.  Unfortunately, the developers don\\'t have a lot\\n\\tof access to EISA or VLB machines, so this is largely an untested\\n\\ttheory.  However, we have yet to see any reports of things not\\n\\tworking on one of these buses and we have several reports of Xfree86\\n\\tworking fine on them.\\n\\n6. What about accelerated boards?\\n\\n\\tAt this time, there is no support in XFree86 for accelerated boards\\n\\tlike the S3, ATI Ultra (8514/A), TIGA, etc.  This support is available\\n\\tin commercial products from SGCS and MetroLink (for SVR3 and SVR4).\\n\\n\\tAn S3 server is available for 386BSD and Linux.  Contact\\n\\t<hasty@netcom.com> for 386BSD or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for Linux.\\n\\n\\tA beta 8514/A server is available for Linux. Contact <martin@cs.unc.edu>\\n\\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. Note: these servers are NOT part of XFree86.\\n\\n7. Why doesn\\'t XFree86 support 16-color VGA modes?\\n\\n\\tThe reason that this is not supported is the way VGA implements the\\n\\t16-color modes.  In 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\\n\\tcontains 1 pixel.  But the 16-color modes are implemented as bit-\\n\\tplanes.  Each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\\n\\tof each of 8 pixels, and there are four such planes.  The MIT frame-\\n\\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  If VGA handled\\n\\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the MIT code\\n\\tcould be modified to support this (or it already may; I\\'m not sure).\\n\\tBut for the VGA way of doing things, a complete new frame-buffer\\n\\timplementation is required.  Some beta testers are looking into this,\\n\\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.\\n\\n8. What other hardware or software requirements are there?\\n\\n\\tObviously, a supported SVGA board and OS are required.  To run\\n\\tX efficiently, 12-16MB of memory should be considered a minimum.\\n\\tThe various binary releases take 10-40MB of disk space, depending\\n\\ton the OS (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).\\n\\tTo build from sources, at least 80MB of free disk space will\\n\\tbe required, although 120MB should be considered a comfortable \\n\\tlower bound.\\n\\n9. Where can I get source for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tSource patches for the current version (1.2, based on X11R5 PL22\\n\\tfrom MIT), are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\texport.lcs.mit.edu (under /contrib/XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au (under /XFree86)\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl (under /pub/XFree86)\\n\\t(For the rest of this FAQ, these 3 location will be called $FTP)\\n\\n\\tRefer to the README file under the specified directory for information\\n\\ton which files you need to get to build your distribution.\\n\\n10. Where can I get binaries for XFree86?\\n\\n\\tBinaries are available via anonymous FTP from:\\n\\t\\tftp.physics.su.oz.au\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tftp.win.tue.nl\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tferkel.ucsb.edu\\t\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/SVR4/XFree86\\n\\t\\tstasi.bradley.edu\\t\\t- SVR4 binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/XFree86/SVR4\\n\\t\\tblancmange.ma.utexas.edu\\t- SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/ISC\\n\\t\\tftp.prz.tu-berlin.de            - SVR3 (ISC) binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/pc/isc/XFree86\\n\\t\\ttsx-11.mit.edu\\t\\t\\t- Linux binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/linux/packages/X11\\n\\t\\tagate.berkeley.edu\\t\\t- 386BSD binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86\\n\\t\\tftp.cs.uwm.edu\\t\\t\\t- Mach binaries\\n\\t\\t\\tunder /i386\\n\\n\\tEnsure that you are getting XFree86 1.2 - some of these sites may\\n\\tarchive older releases as well.  Each binary distribution will\\n\\tcontain a README file that describes what files you need to take\\n\\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections were\\n\\tmade when building the distribution.\\n\\nIV) What general things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n11. Installation directories\\n\\n\\tThe top-level installation directory is specified by the ProjectRoot\\n\\t(/usr/X386, by default) variable in config/site.def. Binaries, include\\n\\tfiles, and libraries are installed in $ProjectRoot/{bin,include,lib}.\\n\\n\\tThis can be changed when rebuilding from sources, and can be modified\\n\\tvia symbolic links for those OSs that support them. This directory is\\n\\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow XFree86 to be installed\\n\\talongside a commercial/vendor-supplied X implementation.\\n\\n12. Configuration files\\n\\n\\tThe XFree86 server reads a configuration file (\"Xconfig\") on startup.\\n\\tThe search path, contents and syntax for this file are documented in\\n\\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted before asking questions.\\n\\n13. Determining VGA dot clocks and monitor modes\\n\\n\\tDavid E Wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known\\n\\tclock settings for VGA cards and monitor settings.\\n\\tThe database is installed in /usr/X386/lib/X11/etc/modeDB.txt, and\\n\\tis in the source tree under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. This database is\\n\\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\\n\\texport.lcs.mit.edu in ~/contrib/X386.modeDB.Z, which is updated\\n\\toccasionally.  Obtain a copy of this database.  It just might have the\\n\\tsettings you need.  If you create new settings, please send them to\\n\\tDavid for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tIf this doesn\\'t help you, the VideoModes.doc (by Eric Raymond) file \\n\\twith XFree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\\n\\tIt may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\\n\\tthis description to get them right.  When you do, send the information\\n\\tto David Wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: The old \\'clock.exe\\' program is not supported any more, and\\n\\t      is completely unnecessary.  If you need to determine dot\\n\\t      clock values for a new board, remove the \\'Clocks\\' line from\\n\\t      your Xconfig file (if present), and start the server.  The\\n\\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\\n\\t      You can use these values to put a \\'Clocks\\' line into your\\n\\t      Xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\\n\\t      starting the server in the future.\\n\\n14. Rebuilding/reconfiguring the server from the link kit\\n\\n\\tIf you have installed the server Binary Link Kit, it is possible to\\n\\treconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server.  This is\\n\\tfully explained in the README file that is available with the link kit.\\n\\nV) What OS-specific things should I know about running XFree86?\\n\\n\\tFirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).\\n\\n15. SVR4\\n\\tWhy won\\'t my xterm run properly?\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\\n\\tCONSEM=no in you environment. Otherwise xterm won\\'t run.\\n\\tcsh users should use \\'setenv CONSEM no\\'\\n\\n\\tThe Esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping\\n\\tproblems with XFree86.  It recommended that this patch not be\\n\\tinstalled.  Alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.\\n\\n16. SVR3\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.ISC, if that\\'s what you are running.\\n\\n17. 386BSD\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.386BSD.\\n\\n\\tAlso, a separate 386BSD FAQ is maintained by Richard Murphey\\n\\t<Rich@Rice.edu>.  The latest version should be available in the\\n\\tfile XFree86-1.2-386BSD-FAQ at the following ftp sites:\\n\\n\\t    agate.berkeley.edu:/pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386BSD/0.1-ports/XFree86-1.2\\n\\n18. Linux\\n\\n\\tYou must be running Linux 0.97pl4 or greater, and have the 4.1 gcc\\n\\tjump libraries installed.\\n\\n\\tMake sure the binaries X386, X386mono, xload and xterm are setuid root.\\n\\n\\tIf your kernel doesn\\'t have TCP support compiled in, you\\'ll have to\\n\\trun the server as \"X -pn\". The default startup configuration assumes\\n\\tthat TCP is not available. If it is, change the two files\\n\\t/usr/X386/bin/startx and /usr/X386/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers, removing the\\n\\t-pn argument to X386.\\n\\n\\tMake sure /dev/console is either a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\\n\\tnumber 4, minor number 0. Also note that if /dev/console is not\\n\\towned by the user running X, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\\n\\tconsole output redirection. Xdm will properly change the owner, but\\n\\tstartx won\\'t.\\n\\n\\tWhen running xdm from rc.local, you will need to provide it with\\n\\ta tty, for example \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\\n\\n\\tFor more detailed information, please read the file README present\\n\\twith the distribution on tsx-11.mit.edu.\\n\\n19. Mach\\n\\n\\tMake sure you look at $FTP/README.Mach.\\n\\nVI) What things should I know for building XFree86 from source?\\n\\n\\tThis section has been removed from the FAQ, since it is\\n\\tfully explained in $FTP/README and the OS-specific READMEs.\\n\\tPlease look at those files for information on building XFree86.\\n\\nVII) Is there anything special about building clients with XFree86?\\n\\n20. BSD compatibility library\\n\\n\\tA lot of clients make use of BSD functions like bcopy(), etc.\\n\\tThe default configuration files are set up to link with libXbsd.a\\n\\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\\n\\tseed(). A better way of providing the \\'b\\' functions is to include\\n\\t<X11/Xfuncs.h> in source files that call them.  Xfuncs.h provides macro\\n\\tdefinitions for these in terms of the SYSV \\'mem\\' functions.  If you are\\n\\tlinking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these\\n\\tfunctions, then you should link with libXbsd.a\\n\\n21. ANSICCOPTIONS\\n\\n\\tThis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\\n\\tANSI-ness defined in the default CCOPTIONS without having to rewrite\\n\\tthe entire CCOPTIONS line.  For example, with stock MIT, you\\'d see\\n\\tsomething like\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-ansi -O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand to get rid of the ANSI-ness, the developer would have to put\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tin his Imakefile.  With this change, you would see a default of\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\"-ansi\"\\n\\t\\tCCOPTIONS=\"-O2 -fwritable-strings\"\\n\\tand all the developer would have to put in the Imakefile is:\\n\\t\\tANSICCOPTIONS=\\n\\tto get rid of the ANSI-ness (many X clients will die a horrible death\\n\\twith -ansi).  The effect is even more dramatic in practice, because\\n\\tCCOPTIONS is actually quite complex.  The other issue is that one must\\n\\tadd \\'ANSICCOPTIONS=$(ANSICCOPTIONS)\\' to a PassCDebugFlags definition.\\n\\nXFree86 Contact Information\\n\\n    Ongoing development planning and support is coordinated by the XFree86\\n    Core Team.

(email: fw@world.std.com)\\nMy thanks to the people who responded, both on usenet and from\\nOracle Corp.\\n\\nThe most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit \\nfeatures or OPS$ passwords to control access (opinion on OPS$\\nincluded suggestions to use and not use). I was also advised to \\nuse table views to refine the granularity of access control.\\n\\nOne important security consideration in networked installations\\nis that OPS$ accounts presume that the client host provides user\\nauthentication. Os/2 server OPS$ users are only as secure as the \\n_least_ secure machine on the network. Hence you should probably \\nnot define any OPS$ accounts on systems with PC's, or limit access \\nof OPS$ accounts to data with no security concerns. Unix oracle \\nservers provide for disabling OPS$ access over the network (orasrv\\noption), while relying on host security for local processes. \\n\\nInternally Oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic) \\naudit mechanisms which the DBA will use to monitor system and\\ndata access. These tools can be used to track the primary security\\nrisks from within the Oracle environment.\\n\\nOracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of DES\\nencryption. Oracle Corp. states that the algorithm is not prone\\nto cleartext attack. This is a difficult claim to substantiate \\nsince the algorithm is unknown. The concern here is that if users \\nchoose easily guessed passwords. _If_ a cracker can gain access \\nto your oracle database files through the host operating system, \\ns/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply \\ncryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.\\n\\nAs security risks go, the above scenario is pretty low severity.\\nCertainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files,\\ns/he can access to the data in them. If a cracker _could_ break \\nthe passwords, however, s/he could do substantial damage without\\nalerting the auditing mechanism's, and leaving and audit trail\\nwhich would point to valid users. At present Oracle (like Unix)\\nprovides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not \\nguessable. \\n\\nAs with all computer security, the most important defense is to \\neducate users in the safe choice of passwords. These techniques\\nare well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the Crack manual, \\n(both available from ftp archive servers) and, UNIX(R) System \\nSecurity (Curry, David A. - Addison-Welsey 1992) \\n\\n\",\n",

Robshaw \\\\\\\\\\n{\\\\tt matt@rsa.com} \\\\and\\nRSA Laboratories \\\\\\\\\\n100 Marine Parkway \\\\\\\\\\nRedwood City, CA  94065}\\n\\\\date{April 23, 1993}\\n\\n\\\\maketitle\\n\\nA message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a\\n``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: Computing the\\ndigest is easy, finding a message with a given\\ndigest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the\\nsame digest---``collision''---is also hard. Message-digest algorithms\\nhave many applications, including digital signatures and message\\nauthentication.\\n\\nRSA Data Security's MD5 message-digest algorithm, developed by Ron\\nRivest \\\\cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.\\nComputing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a\\nsecond.  While no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\\\\em proved}\\nsecure, MD5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps\\nto a 128-bit digest.  Inversion should take about $2^{128}$\\noperations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  No\\none has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.\\n\\nRecent work by den Boer and Bosselaers \\\\cite{den-boer-md5} presents\\na special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in MD5's\\ninternal compression function, which maps\\na 512-bit message block $x$ and a\\n128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output\\nstate. They show how to find a message block $x$\\nand two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same\\noutput state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. Their well-thought approach\\nexploits structural properties of the collision function to find \\na pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one\\nwould expect.\\n\\nPractical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of\\nMD5 are not evident. While a real collision in MD5 implies a\\npseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a\\npseudocollision need not imply a real collision. Indeed, a real\\ncollision, since it involves two different messages, would almost\\nalways involve {\\\\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that\\n$f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same\\nmessage blocks. Moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would\\ngenerally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are\\nthe same except for four bits.  There does not seem to be any way to\\nextend den Boer and Bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the\\nspecial pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.\\n\\nIt is reasonable, therefore, to believe that MD5 remains secure. While den\\nBoer and Bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in\\nMD5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions\\nand not anything approaching real collisions. Further research, of\\ncourse, will give a better understanding of the strengths of MD5 and\\nother message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that\\nsuch algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.\\n\\n\\\\bibliographystyle{plain}\\n\\\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{den-boer-md5}\\nBert den~Boer and Antoon Bosselaers.\\n\\\\newblock Collisions for the compression function of {MD5}.\\n\\\\newblock In {\\\\it Advances in Cryptology --- Eurocrypt '93}, 1993.\\n\\\\newblock Preprint.\\n\\n\\\\bibitem{rfc-md5}\\nR.L.

       "  '\\n(about my reply)\\n\\n\\nIt a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy\\nis the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nKevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little\\nabout, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical \\'insight\\' cannot\\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor\\'s new mind: Concerning\\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose\\'s\\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\\ncould be just illusions.\\n\\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \\njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\\nin the future perform a \"total synthesis of C. elegans\" from\\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\\n\\n\\nThis is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains\\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \\n\\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \\nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\\nconscious. \\n\\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\\n\\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don\\'t forget this. This does not\\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\\nTheir primary \\'purpose\\' is perception and guidance of action, \\nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\\n\\n\\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \\'green\\' in\\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\\nnot how I see it. The sensation \\'green\\' is a certain time-dependent\\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \\n\\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\\nbut this is just idle speculation.\\n\\nScientific American\\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \\ninterested.\\n\\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \\nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \\nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\\nmind.\\n\\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \\npatients\\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\\n\\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\\ntherapist.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\\n\\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \\n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\\n\\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\\n\\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\\n   of our \\'conscious will\\' by at least 350 ms. \\n\\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do \\'I\\' see\\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this \\'I\\' that seems to be \\nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\\nthe king of our brains.\\n\\n\\nThis depends on what is meant by \\'seeing colours\\'. Does a neural\\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\\n\\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\\ndoesn\\'t\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\\nroles and act more morally, so that they don\\'t unconsciously\\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\\nbut this is the basic idea.)\\n\\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \\na sense of identity and the concept of \\'self\\' had to evolve in\\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \\nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \\n\\n\\nIf minds are required for this, does this mean that until human\\nminds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained\\nin the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.\\n\\nThis has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,\\nsince we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do\\nphysicists. \\n\\n\\nI agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics\\nneeds sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s OK, if you don\\'t forget to take with you the references I\\nwrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:\\n\\nKalat, James W.

Pass a law stating that if, within a\\nyear of performaing a wiretap on someone, a police agency hasn't\\nmanaged to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for,\\nthen that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for\\nlost privacy.\\n   Of course, there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of\\nClipper, and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind\\nan attempt to enforce it as a standard.  But this would be a way for\\nthose in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will\\nonly be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are\\nall but certain that there really will be a conviction....\",\n",

Thus, we are left with\\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\\nthe many?  We say \"no,\" while others say \"yes.\"\\n\\n\\n\\tCan you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.\\n\\n\\n\\tOf course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention\\nis how much one has to pay.\\n\\n\\n\\tIt is this \"giving a little\" that makes Americans wary...\\nWe have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a\\nChamberlain \"gave a little\" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\\nand how such \"appeasement\" worked.  While it might work in some\\ninstances, it doesn\\'t work in others, and since we cannot predict\\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\\nhistory of failure.\\n\\n\\n\\tCars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\\nthe USA.  I\\'m willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines \"essential\" often depends\\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\\n\\n\\n\\tThis depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won\\'t just revolt even\\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\\nThus, we\\'re left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\\n\\n\\n\\tIt is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.  I only wish that \"or\" was so logical.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat was, on my part, purely in jest.  I merely pointed out\\nhow we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different\\nbackgrounds politically.  I thought this would underscore my point on\\nhow our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.\\n\\n\\n\\tBATF can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  Child\\nabuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  Most people do\\nnot get it for this reason, and I suspect money, not censorship, is the\\nmain reason.  Do you get alt.sex* at your site?  I can\\'t read it here\\nbecause of censorship and legal fears, so again our differences show.\\nYou have topless sunbathing, and in the USA we can watch a murder every\\nfifteen seconds and yet breasts are forbidden on television.',\n",

I brought up the \\'one-by-one dismissal\\' process to\\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\\'re saying in this\\npost, it seems you agree, and we\\'re talking at cross-purposes.\\n\\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\\n#\\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\\n#\\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\\n#\\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug\\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\\n#\\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\\n#\\n#so\\n#\\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\\n#\\n#but (3) implies that\\n#\\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\\n\\nNo, this isn\\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\\nnecessarily no new observation (we\\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\\'s\\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \\nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \\nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\\nthat the answer can\\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates\\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\\n\\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by \"the universe is caused by x\",\\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\\n#\\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don\\'t \"throw out\" any of\\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\\n\\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\\nMy sole point was that they aren\\'t.\\n\\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\\n#>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the\\n#>> hypotheses out.\\n#\\n#> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.\\n#\\n#You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.\\n\\nI was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.\\n\\n#> What I\\'m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of\\n#> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for\\n#> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isn\\'t true that those for\\n#> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.\\n#\\n#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which\\n#can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this\\n#thread.\\n\\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\\nmeans that you\\'re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we\\'ve already\\nestablished that it\\'s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\\nall i.\\n\\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\\n#> at worst barking mad.\\n#\\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\\n#occasions. You wouldn\\'t be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\\n#Although that doesn\\'t, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\\n#\\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\\n#\"evidence against\" an hypothesis, that doesn\\'t imply that observation of\\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\\'s still\\n#evidence against H.\\n\\nNo, I got that.  I\\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\\'re clearly\\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I\\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\\'s\\ncertainly possible that I\\'ve misunderstood what you\\'re saying).  However,\\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\\'t exist, or are unnecessary\\nto explain any or all phenomena.

Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.',\n",

       "  'Folks,\\n\\nIt\\'s time to start building some precise questions to send to our\\nfederal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our\\nlocal TV, radio and newprint media.  Ideally, these questions could be\\nasked at any investigation into the BATF\\'s and FBI\\'s participation\\nat the WACO fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake\\nup the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth\\nfrom the BATF and FBI.  My list is up to 13 that are really nagging \\nat my gut.  The list will probably grow. \\n\\n1.   What were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that\\n     the BATF obtained?\\n\\n2.   It is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition\\n     could not be flushed down the toilet.  Therefore, a \"no-knock\"\\n     raid could be ruled out.  Prior to the initial assault on the \\n     complex, did a single BATF agent and accompanying witness (without \\n     a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock \\n     on the door of the Branch Davidian\\'s complex and serve the warrant \\n     in a manner prescribed by law?\\n\\n3.   On the day of the initial assault on the complex, BATF agents\\n     were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.\\n     In the ensueing gun battle, BATF agents fired into a building\\n     known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.\\n     Knowing children were present, why didn\\'t the BATF have an\\n     alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to\\n     the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening\\n     fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? \\n\\n4.   The FBI spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that\\n     David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians possessed over\\n     $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  Did David Koresh and the\\n     members of the Branch Davidians have a valid Federal Firearms\\n     License, were they actively participating in the legal business\\n     of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the\\n     weapons they had illegally possessed?  Does this paper evidence\\n     consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally\\n     dispossessed weapons.\\n\\n5.   After the original assault on the compound tragically failed,\\n     a BATF spokeswoman stated \"We were outgunned!\".  Yet, TV newscasts\\n     of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show BATF agents\\n     armed with MP-5 and AR-15/M16 rifles.  Although unclear on the\\n     video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent\\'s\\n     bodies, they also may have had AK-47 and SKS rifles.  What type(s)\\n     of firearms did the BATF agents have immediate access to at the \\n     scene of the original assault on the complex?\\n\\n6.   Since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the\\n     complex involuntarily, why did the FBI treat it as a \"hostage\"\\n     situation? \\n\\n7.   Along the same lines, why did the FBI use \"psychological warfare\"\\n     techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and\\n     other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any \\n     normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the \\n     complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?\\n\\n8.   Reports indicate several of the children inside the complex\\n     were accompanied by their mothers.  Since it is reasonable\\n     to expect these mothers would have their children taken away\\n     from them if they came out, why did the FBI expect the mothers\\n     to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?\\n\\n9.   Agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the Branch\\n     Davidians setting fire to the complex.  Branch Davidian members\\n     who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an \\n     armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a \\n     lantern which was setting on a table.  Video tape of the incident \\n     does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the \\n     fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  \\n     Was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle \\n     penetrated?\\n\\n10.  FBI spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the David Koresh and\\n     the members of the Branch Davidians committed mass suicide.  Yet,\\n     bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas\\n     within the building complex.  This seems to be counter to any\\n     known mass suicides through history.  What evidence does the FBI\\n     have that a mass suicide pact existed?\\n\\n11.  FBI Director Sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on\\n     the video tape was caused by the Branch Davidian\\'s ammunition\\n     and/or powder cache exploding.  Yet, the fireball seems to be\\n     more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas\\n     or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  Was any evidence \\n     found which would indicate the Branch Davidians had an ammunition \\n     and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  If so,\\n     and if David Koresh and members of the Branch Davidians were \\n     engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the\\n     amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect\\n     for someone engaged in such a legal business?\\n\\n12.  It is rumored that one FBI agent was extremely upset about critical\\n     news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to\\n     crush a reporter\\'s car which had been left at the compound.  Is \\n     there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will \\n     be brought against the FBI agent who performed the act?\\n\\n13.  FBI Director Sessions states that, during the final assault on the\\n     complex, \"over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles.\"  On the video\\n     tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles\\n     engines.  Yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one\\n     would expect to hear if shots were fired.  Also, there are no \\n     indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,\\n     buildings or other structures in the video.  Surely, these should be \\n     evident if the Branch Davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  \\n     Finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, \\n     sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be \\n     apparent if the Branch Davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  Do \\n     any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas \\n     into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by \\n     shots from high-power rifles?\\n\\n14.  CS gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  The United\\n     States has signed international treaties which prevent the use\\n     of CS gas in warfare.  If the United States could not morally use\\n     CS gas against Saddam Hussein and his troops, why is it morally\\n     acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?\\n\\n15.  On April 21, FBI spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered\\n     in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had\\n     been murdered or had committed suicide.  On April 22, the county\\n     coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet\\n     wounds to the head.  Were any of the victims bodies found within\\n     the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?',\n",
       "  '-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\nPlease note that the following speech was made by Chuck Hammill\\nin 1987.  Address all letters to his address, given at the end\\nof this document.\\n     -- Russell\\n\\n  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\\n                     TECHNOLOGY\\n\\n  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\\n\\n\\n     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\\ntechnology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\\ncles.  We tend to think of Orwell\\'s 1984, or Terry Gilliam\\'s\\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin\\'s\\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\\nlongings if it beeps.\\n\\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\\n\\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\\nmerit  of  the  new  (over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\\n\\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\\nget.)\\n\\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\\n\\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\\ntrue one.\\n\\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one\\'s\\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\\nX-MP  can\\'t  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\\nwill  have  totally demolished government\\'s control over in-\\nformation transfer.\\n\\n     I\\'d like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\\ncomputer now in existence.\\n\\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\\nother factor  y.\\n\\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\\nyield the original number started with.\\n\\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\\nan encrypted message, namely\\n                       x\\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\\n\\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\\nyour pq)  and send that.\\n\\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\\ny).\\n\\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\\nweren\\'t threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\\n\\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don\\'t make the sale, there\\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\\n\\n     For my part, I\\'m ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn\\'t\\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus\\'s characters, we\\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\\n\\n     But  there\\'s  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what\\'s not\\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\\n\\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\\n\\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\\n\\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life\\'s labor.\\n\\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\\nsome  sort  if  we\\'re ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\\nously  can\\'t  use  the  altruists\\'  \"other-directedness\"  of\\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today\\'s culture.\\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\\nchildren are dead) maybe your children\\'s children will actu-\\nally  live under egoism\"--you\\'d all think I\\'d gone mad.  And\\nof course you\\'d be right.  Because the point I\\'m  trying  to\\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\\nthen.\\n\\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\\ntical  action, I don\\'t believe that it is the only, nor even\\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who\\'s in-\\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\\nunilaterally.\\n\\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\\nthe saying, you might well feel that you\\'ve heard  it  often\\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\\nand moreover, that maybe you\\'re even tired of hearing it.  I\\nshall therefore repeat it now:\\n\\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\\nfor a lifetime.\\n\\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\\n\\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\\nbeggars as we may encounter.\\n\\n     But consider:\\n\\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn\\'t know how to  fish,  but  he\\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that\\'s\\nanarchy!\\n\\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people\\'s\\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens\\' bodies are thought\\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\\n\\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\\nthis tyrant\\'s goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\\nhaps even other motives.)\\n\\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\\nyour \"cause,\" you\\'re not about to mount a military campaign,\\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\\nyour mythical Eskimo\\'s public-key parameters.  But as far as\\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne\\'s dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\\n\\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\\n\\n     And  that\\'s  where  I\\'m  trying  to  take The LiberTech\\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\\nfreedom for ourselves.\\n\\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\\nit does indicate how government thinks.\\n\\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\\ndrug.\\n\\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\\nself.\\n\\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\\nbefore  I\\'ll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\\nself free.\\n\\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you\\'ll go on the\\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.

All of this was\\nsupposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.\\n\\nDepends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will\\nspend \"three days and three nights in the heart of the earth\", and Mark 10:34\\nhas \"after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again\". As far as I can\\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\\n\\n\\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\\nwas dark.\\n\\n\\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\\n\\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \\nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\\nanoint him.\\n\\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \\nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\\nsepulchre.\\n\\n\\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\\nand sat upon it.\\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\\n\\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \\nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\\n\\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\\n\\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \\nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\\n\\n\\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\\nthis claim.\\n\\n\\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\\nto the visit with the disciples.\\n\\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\\n\\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\\nthey told the\\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\\nand honey and then preached to them.\\n\\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\\tOnce\\nmore Jesus made an\\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\\nrecognised.\\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\\ntogether and converse.\\n\\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \\nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\\n\\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\\nassension, although he does not say where.\\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\\n\\n\\nMatthew says nothing about it.\\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\\ndisciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that\\nwhile he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. \\nJohn says nothing about it.

They claim that\\nthese keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they\\nget a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip),\\nthey have to get the keys from both companies.  People have poked holes\\nthrough and through the press release official version and shown how\\nit is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and I have given the simplified\\nversion.  People over on sci.crypt are really scared about this\\nproposal it seems.',\n",

       "  \"News:\\n=====\\nFor the first time all season, the Flames are now injury-free. The only player\\nremaining on the limp is center Carey Wilson who, even when healthy, is not \\na major part of the team. \\n\\nTrent Yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season\\ngame against San Jose. He potted his first of the year in that game, and has\\nalso scored goals in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Los Angeles. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 1:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with\\nLos Angeles 6-3 on Sunday afternoon. They seemed more interested in throwing\\nbig hits than in scoring goals. They physically dominated the Kings, but that\\nwas the only area they dominated in. The game plan was to rush the net and \\ntry and take advantage of a young, inexperienced L.A. defence and the shaky\\nKings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the Flames\\nconducted a steady march to the penalty box. Particularily stupid was Theoren\\nFleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming Warren\\nRychel's face into the dasher while Rychel was on his knees. \\n\\nGoaltender Mike Vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the\\nloss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. He got\\nvery little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and \\nsweeping away rebounds. In fact, Marty McSorley's goal actually went in off\\nChris Dahlquist's skate in front of the net. \\n\\nThoughts on Game 2:\\n==================\\n\\nThe Flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the\\npotentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.\\nThe first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the Kings. But Calgary\\ncame out strong in the second period and simply dominated the Kings, scoring\\nfive goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. \\n\\nThe deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. Calgary\\ndominated on faceoffs as they did in Game 1, but they were able to make better\\nuse of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. Calgary\\nalso went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while L.A. only went 1-for-8 and gave up\\na shorthanded goal to Joel Otto. L.A.'s powerplay goal also came late in the\\ngame with the outcome already decided. The Kings' powerplay failed them when\\nthey needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. \\n\\nThe Flames lost RW Greg Paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he\\nwas leveled by Alexei Zhitnik right after scoring Calgary's 7th goal. Charlie\\nHuddy left the game for the Kings with a groin injury. \\n\\nThe game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. First, Craig Berube of\\nCalgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for\\ninstigating when he went after Tony Granato for no apparent reason. Granato\\ndrew a minor for some strange reason. (Turtling perhaps). This was followed\\n30 seconds later by Warren Rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct\\nfor hitting Frank Musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a\\nfight. Musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. Hardy and\\nYawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (Gregson thought that Musil \\nturtling amounted to fighting, but that Yawney and Hardy throwing punches at \\neach other was just roughing?

       " 'DESCR': '.. _20newsgroups_dataset:\\n\\nThe 20 newsgroups text dataset\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe 20 newsgroups dataset comprises around 18000 newsgroups posts on\\n20 topics split in two subsets: one for training (or development)\\nand the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation). The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"

This makes sense, because this frequency distribution represents all the classes combined. This tells us that these words are probably the least important, as they are most likely words that are used across multiple classes, thereby providing our model with little actual signal as to what class they belong to. This tells us that we probably want to focus on words that appear heavily in articles from a given class, but rarely appear in articles from other classes.
